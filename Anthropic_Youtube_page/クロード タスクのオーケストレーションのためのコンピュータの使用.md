- I'm Pujaa and I'm a researcher at Anthropic. I'm going to show you a simple example of computer use today. My friend is coming to San Francisco next week and I want to take him to do some touristy stuff. I think doing a sunrise hike with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge never gets old. So I'll ask Claude to figure out some logistics for us.
- I'll ask Claude to find a good place to see the sunrise to help me figure out timing logistics, and help drop a calendar invite so I remember when I have to leave. It's opening Chrome, going to Google, searching... ...and it looks like it's found something. Great.
- So how far away is the location from my place? It's opening Maps. Searching for the distance between my area and the hiking location. Cool, so now it looks like Claude is searching for the sunrise time tomorrow. And is now dropping it into my calendar. And populating it with some details. And great, it looks like Claude did it.
- This is a simple example, but we're sharing computer use early to learn from what people build.
