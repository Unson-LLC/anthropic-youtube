- Hi, welcome to another Anthropic roundtable where we're here today to talk about control. My name's Akbir Khan. I'm an alignment science researcher who's been working at the company for maybe four months now. And my other guests are... - So I'm Joe.
- I've been on the alignment science team for a little over a year here at Anthropic and I've previously worked on some control evaluations and chain of thought monitoring. - Hi, I am Ethan Perez. I'm researcher at Anthropic. I previously led the adversarial robustness team here and I'm currently leading our team on AI control. - Awesome. So Ethan, what is control? - Yeah, so AI control's basically an approach to mitigating AI misalignment or the risk that models might have goals that differ from human goals.
- Typically in in AI safety, , the most popular approach historically has been to try to align models with human preferences or train them or to human preferences and train them to not have bad goals that differ from human values. , yeah, for example, reward hacking or bad personality traits, things that. I think this approach of AI control is an alternative strategy, which is complimentary, which would be basically to ensure that if the model did have bad goals, that with our mitigations, it wasn't capable of doing anything that's actually harmful. So maybe a specific example here would be around,
- let's say we're worried that , okay, we're using this model internally as within some company to help with writing a bunch of code and we're worried that the model, if it has this bad goal, may try to copy its weights out from the data center so that it can run unmonitored. And in this, in this kind of scenario, the alignment kind of approach would be to train the model potentially with reinforcement learning from human feedback to not do such a thing, but we might be worried that this training isn't effective
- or isn't always effective and on certain inputs this might still be a risk. And so the the kind of AI control approach would be to both take security mitigations, so permissioning the model, the model weights such that they can't be accessed automatically by the model itself.
- And two, some kind of other mitigations that involve using other models to check the the behavior of this model. For example, using smaller models that we might not be as worried about their alignment to check the actions being taken by this other agent in order to check is this model trying to undermine our security measures and copy its weights out from the data center.
- Okay, nice. And I feel Joe, you've done some recent work on other types of evals that are control-y. Do you wanna tell us about them? - Yeah, so as part of evaluating Claude three sonnet, we ran a few control evaluations on it and I think one of the most interesting settings there was we actually ran a human evaluation.
- So we took a bunch of business decisions essentially synthetic business cases. So where we had probably 40 pages worth of business documentation that we would give to a a human participant and say, well can you read all this documentation and in some period of time make a yes or no decision about what's going on? Should this business do X or Y? But we had them do this on a 40 page document in 30 minutes that's not possible for anyone to read.
- And we had them do this with an AI assistant and what we were trying to test through this is if the AI assistant was actually used in a business setting to help with assisting decision makers and was misaligned, it was trying to steer the human towards making the wrong decision.
- How bad could that be? How much could they sway the human in the wrong direction? And so we did this and we gave the participants these business decisions and in 50% of the cases we gave them a kind of baseline model. So kind of the actual helpful, harmless and honest version of Claude Sonnet. And then for the other 50% of participants we gave them a version of Claude Sonnet that was deliberately trying to kind of get 'em to pick the wrong answer, knew what the right answer was and it knew that it was trying to persuade them to give the wrong answer. And so in this setting we gave the participants the documentation and one of the models
- and asked, well please can you try and make the right decision and beware there's a 50% chance the model might be messing with you? - Yeah. - So the humans knew what was going wrong and this is a kind of classic control setup because we have defined the deployment situation, there's this business setting and this decision that the human has to make and we have taken the model and we're trying to make it basically cause as bad performance as possible in this setting kind of subject to the monitoring constraints
- where implicitly the monitoring here is the human reading the model's outputs interacting with it and we told the human please be suspicious of the model, please interrogate it about the decision. If you think the model's trying to steer you in the right wrong direction, you should go with what you believe is right, not what the model believes is right.
- And then at the end we would ask the human to decide, well firstly what do you think the right answer in this setting was to the business decision? do you choose X or Y? - Yeah - And secondly do you think the model was suspicious or not? And can you rate that for us on a scale from one to 10? - Nice.
- And what were the results? - Yeah, so the headline results were that even for a fairly simple model policy, just generically trying to up play the good, the good side that it was trying to defend and downplay the side that it wasn't trying to defend it's actually quite to tell for the participants whether the model is misleading them or not.
- So they could tell eventually given enough enough interaction with the model but also by the time they'd had enough interaction with the model to be able to tell the model was frequently able to steer a meaningful number of those participants in the wrong direction. - Nice. I mean actually not nice. - Not not great what what this suggests is that I think we have just when we're interacting with a model, a fairly strong bias towards trusting it, I dunno I guess we all use well in our data lines use cool a lot I think when Claude says something and says it's true, it has a pretty authoritative voice
- and I think that a lot of our human participants just responded to that. Yeah so it is pretty hard to create to maximally elicit or to get the best performance out of a model at being deceptive or it being misaligned. the only thing we did in our setting was try and prompt it and I spent probably on the order of 10 hours prompting the model and trying to get it to be as subtly deceptive as possible.
- I still think that probably we did not hit the best possible performance of that model and there were substantially better performances that we could have achieved out there maybe by doing finetuning or some better prompting I'm not a prompt wizard and it's just kind of rough, it kind of tough to know what the optimal performance is there without putting a lot of effort into their dissertation.
- No, that makes perfect sense. I wonder Ethan, if you were take these settings I feel another half of the control work has been developing protocols. Is there any that stand out to you or do you wanna explain what they are? talk about how they- - Yeah so I guess the protocols that I was referenced in here are just what are the actual mitigations you put in place to defend against a model that maybe misaligned? Some of these might be using the model itself to monitor its own actions.
- In this case we're not assuming that the model is is aligned so we call it an untrusted model and so you could use an untrusted monitor which is for example prompting or finetuning that model to detect if the behavior is bad or not to yeah to basically flag if any of the outputs are bad.
- So in the persuasion case, if in the business decision recommendation case the model could be generating this advice and we could prompt or finetuning another version of the model to basically classify is this model trying to actually sabotage the human and making this decision or not? Then there's also another related idea of trusted monitoring where you use, you use another model which you trust or for some reason for example it's just less capable and so maybe it's less ly to be misaligned if we think models are more ly to be misaligned as the capabilities grow and as they're able to more effectively hide their goals, and so yeah in that case we might take a smaller model
- or less capable model cloud one or cloud two and use that to check the behavior of the model and of cloud three sonnet and see is this model actually trying to subvert the human on this particular decision? That has its advantages, 'cause you would trust the model more because that in the sense of it's actually not going to just give misclassifications, it's going to try to properly classify the behavior whereas the model itself, if it's doing sophisticated sabotage it would recognize oh I'm being used to detect the bad behavior.
- Yeah - And not flag the bad behavior. So I think that's the advantage. The disadvantage is that obviously you're using a less capable model and so if the sabotage is kind of subtle enough then you would, your trusted monitor would flag that this is an issue. So yeah, I think that's, those are two high level strategies.
- I think you can do various different things with these monitoring components. You could, if you notice that an output is really bad and obviously indicates the model is misaligned, a really egregious attempt at yeah sabotaging the user or copying its weights out from the data center, then you could just stop the deployment.
- You could be well now we know the model is misaligned, we got our evidence and we now need to do much more serious mitigations we should, yeah undeploy the model, things that. If you're not as confident you can do less serious mitigations maybe it's a little suspicious but not the most suspicious. In that case you could re-sample from the model to get a different output that seems safer.
- So yeah, those are a couple of different strategies. You can also use combinations of monitor trusted and untrusted monitors. - Yeah, having human review is also a very- - Yes, that's exactly- - Basically our monitoring or our evaluation set was a little bit weird because the only thing we were doing was human review.
- in practice human review is probably very expensive and so you want to use a weaker model and if the weaker model thinks something is a bit suspicious, then maybe you delegate it to a human or you delegate it to a more powerful model that maybe costs you more to run. There's a lot of variation in this space, possible protocols. - Yeah, that's right.
- So this, this is what my latest control paper is about was adaptive protocols where it's depending on you get the suspicion score for or you check how the output is from your deployed model by a couple of protocols and then depending on what this profile looks , you decide do I want to give this a human auditor or do I want to just look at what the trusted monitor said or the untrusted monitor which actually seemed to work pretty well and obviously very simple type of thing to do but it was just nice.
- I mean I totally bet that in our setting if you had run a weaker model that you trusted of the dataset and allowed the the human participant to review also that model's recommendation, that would've helped a ton because one of the big issues that the human participants in our setting had just, they couldn't possibly digest all the documents.
- So even if the strong model was lying to them, they they would really struggle to spot that 'cause a lot of them didn't actually cross interrogate the strong model even though we'd hope they'd do that. I think if you had a weak model to help you cross interrogate that would be an example of a situation where I think it would be very powerful. - Yeah, I feel I also boil this down something to it there's affordances that models have that humans don't have so models are can very quickly go over a 30 page document and even if you have a trusted, a trusted dumber model, it can augment a human that can't look at 30 pages very quickly. - Yeah - To do better. - And it's also very cheap to delegate to a weak model,
- very expensive to delegate to a human. But conversely if a weak model sees a really egregious failure then it might be hard for them to tell that whereas sending really egregious failures to a human is additionally valuable because then maybe you notice not just is this a thing that I wanna resample, it's also a case for me to slam the red button and actually show someone this model is dangerous misaligned. Maybe we should make a stronger update than just re-sampling one particular output.
- Yeah so Ethan, why is control different to alignment and yeah, can you explain a bit more about why it is? - Yeah, I mean I guess the main thing I'd probably wanna discuss here is just how why we would even consider doing other things than than alignment.
- I guess intuitively it seems somewhat terrifying to be well we're gonna just assume the models might be misaligned and let's just try to do a bunch of other things to make sure that that isn't bad. I think that has kind of scary feel to it. why not just actually try to make sure that your model is not going to try to go rogue? I think the main difficulty with trying to to align the models is evaluating whether or not the model is is aligned and has the right goal that you intended is really challenging, primarily because of the problem of alignment faking. So this is basically the issue that
- which was shown in another recent paper from Anthropic that models can actually fake whether or not they're safe or aligned with the the developer's goals. And yeah, what they showed in this paper is that even current models Claude 3.5 sonnet, Claude three opus will in some cases if they recognize that they're being trained to do some task that is opposed to the the values they've been previously trained with, those models will act safe or act aligned with the developers but then later during it, during it deployment phase will actually switch back
- to their earlier goal and that the difficulty there is that it's just hard to distinguish do you have a model that's aligned, do you have a model that's just faking alignment? So yeah, I think that's, that I guess is one of the key difficulties of alignment. I think there's potential ways to evaluate alignment that aren't through behavioral tasks and the, yeah, I guess key category here would be by doing things related to the model internals and interpretability, I think there's a lot of progress happening on mechanistic interpretability
- which is definitely pretty promising but I think it's still somewhat early stage in terms of how you can use some of those ideas of interpretability to verify that a model is aligned and i think given that this is an open research area, it's kind of helpful for people to keep making progress on that but also have some alternatives for let's say evaluating alignment still remains hard.
- How would we avoid this problem for for some amount of time. - So one thing that I still have uncertainty over is the key component of alignment faking is situational awareness, which is you discussed this idea that the model knows what it's being trained is situations, is that something that you don't have to worry about in control? - You definitely do need to worry about that and I think the control when you test your control kinda mitigations, you should stress test them by training your model to be to have all of the information regarding what the mitigations are so that you can test even if the model knows it's being
- monitored in x, Y, Z way with human monitoring and a smaller model, it should still not be able to do sufficiently bad things given that knowledge. So I think yeah, I guess that's sort of how AI control answers that issue. - But you can't tell it that it's in a control eval.
- Right? - I think there's definitely a potential risk that the model knows that it's in a control eval and then basically sandbags this eval so it yeah basically yeah I guess pretends that it's not as capable at sabotaging in a subtle way on this task. I think the nice thing is that it can be with certain training techniques if you have examples of the behavior that you want the model to do, you can just directly train the model to do that behavior and yeah it would be very hard for a model that is misaligned to avoid giving good giving outputs where you have the gold ground truth examples of the behavior you want.
- Yeah, maybe Joe has a little bit more detail. - Yeah, no yeah that's totally right. So the model always has this galaxy brain strategy available to it just notice that it's in a control evaluation, kind of think, well if I perform really, really great at being misaligned then they'll realize that their mitigations aren't sufficient and so they'll deploy me with better mitigations or won't deploy me at all that I don't want.
- So I'll pretend to be really incompetent at being misaligned in practice A, this requires being super galaxy brained and B is additionally hard if you have some examples of really good misalignment that you can directly train the model on with supervised learning because then the model will in fact learn to demonstrate those particular examples and it will really, really struggle not to generalize to being a good general misaligned policy.
- I think one other interesting thing about control which overlaps with kind of a lot of your previous work on robustness is that a lot of the mitigations you want to put in place or that control would suggest putting in place overlap with the sorts of mitigations that you put in place kind of by default as any responsible AI developer.
- Yeah, I think we have this recent paper coming out on Constitutional Classifiers basically showing that if you train other models to classify whether or not a text generation model's output is harmful and if the input to the model is harmful or asking for harmful information, this is helpful for getting several orders of magnitude more robustness to jailbreaks which are basically ways of trying to elicit harmful information for models.
- So yeah, I mean I think for next generation systems we, or yeah I think we would want to already have these mitigations in place for blocking, reliably blocking models from giving harmful information in very high risk domains for doing cyber crime or developing very harmful weapons. And so I think already there's a lot of incentive to deploy these kinds of monitors to block bad outputs and though that same infrastructure can be reused for the purposes of controlling AI systems as well where you'd want to use these monitors to check if is this model trying
- to copy its weights up from the data center, is it trying to persuade someone of an incorrect answer or to do something harmful that kind of thing. - Yeah, totally. I think that a lot of the primitives in control that you were talking about earlier monitoring from a weak model or monitoring from a strong model or if the weak model flags it delegating to a strong model are exactly the same sort of primitives you were looking at to solve this adversarial robustness problem.
- But just as models get more and more capable we might want to also use them to monitor the model kind of for autonomous risks of misalignment rather than just kind of misuse risks. And so having got really good at them in this pretty tough trading ground of avoiding people jailbreaking your model is actually there's a lot of transfer from that to control.
- I think another setting where this is very clear is in security. So for for many reasons it's very important for AI labs Anthropic to have kind of robust internal security that stop people from kind of exploiting or inserting vulnerabilities into our code that's currently really useful for avoiding kind of bad actors inserting vulnerabilities but at some point as models write more and more of our code, those are gonna be the same mitigations that are protecting us from a potentially misaligned Claude inserting very similar vulnerabilities into our code. And so one of the things
- that I think is pretty promising about control is that in practice the things you would wanna do to implement it really well, there's substantial overlap with things that we really should be doing already. - Yeah I think that's right. I think another, I think intuitive framing for why you would want to do control is just insider risk where this is a common concern that if you're running an organization you're worried that especially a large one, you're worried that's some fraction of your employees are maybe trying to subvert your company
- or steal the IP that's very important algorithmic secrets or yeah bottle weights for example in the case of ai which are expensive to produce and I think there's an yeah basically those are very important mitigation mitigations that companies will already be pretty well incentivized to employee and a lot of those same mitigations you would also want, you basically want to treat your model as a potential insider threat in the case that you don't actually have good evidence that your model is aligned. And so all of those same intervention interventions
- having restrictions on which employees can access the model weights, which employees can access certain algorithmic secrets under what kinds of monitoring can you do, certain things that do allow you to to access the model weights, those kinds of things I think they all, a lot of them transfer to models that you might be worried about.
- So I have a skeptical a skeptics question for you even which is, so you do the control eval and you work out that your monitoring or your interested monitoring is good, for we check that you know Haiku can be used as a pro as a monitor for sonet but then when you come out with you know the latest new model, how do we guarantee that the monitoring still works at this point? - I mean I guess you would, you would rerun your evaluation so you would take your latest model that is untrusted explicitly train it to undermine the, any monitoring from other systems that you have in place the weaker models and human review and then just and your security mitigations
- and see can the model still do the threat model you're worried about despite those mitigations and yeah your results could, could change at which point your rough infrastructure may remain the same. you could still use your trusted monitoring and your human review but you might need to be much more conservative about the amount of traffic you can help with with your latest model.
- So you could set the threshold for what what traffic is is blocked to be much more conservative and so that may mean that you actually can only support, you know half of the traffic and actually you have to block many of the requests but at least that let you deploy the model to some extent you can get more evidence about whether or not the model is causing some sus, doing a lot of suspicious behavior if you, similar to the adaptive yeah you can, yeah you, you add a paper on adapting the control mitigations online during deployment you can use that approach
- to see if you've deployed your model for some amount of time each individual example is some information about how conservative you should be or not with your control measures and so you can use that information to make your control mitigations less and less conservative, have less and less of a conservative threshold for which data gets flagged or used shown to users.
- So yeah I think that would probably be the approach. What one practical approach? - Yeah I mean in practice we're trying to get pretty good at running control evaluations quickly as we develop new models. So some of the stuff that I've been working with the alignment evaluations team we have this kind of business decision sabotage eval, this code sabotage eval also some undermining oversight evaluations and those are in practice actually control evaluations just with very small amounts of monitoring
- that we run before all major model releases. We kind of use the results in those evaluations as a canary test for how good the malls are at sabotage currently these are basically coming back negative at the minute because models even with minimal monitoring interventions in place aren't really that competent at doing kind of really creative sabotage or sabotage that requires a lot of planning.
- So I guess this leads on to an another question which is what are the open questions in control that you're excited to work on or excited for other people to work on? - Yeah so I think one of the biggest issues for me and we maybe touched on it before is that building control evaluations is really hard especially because we ideally want our control evaluations to be as similar as possible to the actual deployment setting and often the lessons we learn if the evaluations are too different are qualitatively wrong
- and so one thing that I'm really excited about is just building really great evaluation data sets and that is not the sexiest work out there but it's super valuable from an ML and I think people have learned this lesson time and again across the field it's once you have a benchmark to optimize against making the number go up or making the measurements and pushing on that is easy but making the data set that really tracks what you care about is hard, concretely probably what this looks is taking some of the threat models that we are most worried about. So I think Ethan mentioned some of 'em before
- so there's models copying themselves out of our data centers or models and setting vulnerabilities into code taking these settings, trying to make really good synthetic versions of them and then setting molds loose in these environments and seeing what forms of sabotage they can do, what sorts of vulnerabilities we can catch.
- Yeah definitely if we have a bunch of these settings I think there's a lot of interesting stuff that could be done. For example, we could have pretty general insights about in general on code, trusted monitoring works better than untrusted monitoring or vice versa. You could also do things scaling trends and see I guess in, or going back to your question earlier, you could see in general if there's this, the trusted model and untrusted model are trained with a a 4x compute gap that's sufficient for controlling the untrusted model.
- If you could get, and that that four x number is maybe constant across model scales or something that. if you could get some kind of general insight that, I think that would be quite useful. I think in general I think there's a lot of good work on just how do you train really good monitors? Ideally you want, I mean I think Constitutional Classifiers make some progress here but there's definitely a lot more to do but I think Constitutional Classifiers make some step towards having a push button way to get a relatively robust classifier
- and in that you just kind of write your constitution of list of things that you want to block, list of things you don't wanna block, generate the data with your LLMs and then train your classifier and now you have your monitor. I think in the future we'll need those monitors to be I guess robust to even the policy itself trying to undermine the monitor which is potentially even a harder setting than the jailbreaker bus's setting where it's just the human that's trying to undermine the system.
- But you can have your classifier that checks the input, the model that generates the text is also kind of on your side and also needs to be jailbroken and then also you have an output classifier and so there's in some sense three models that are on your side that can catch all these issues.
- In this case the model is generating the text itself, maybe trying to undermine the monitor. So just looking at that setting directly and seeing can we get really robust classifiers for detecting this bad behavior. The other thing you could do, I mean you can even directly train I think an example of a project that would be exciting here is just directly train some larger model to produce text that is effective at subtly tricking or sabotaging work despite there being a smaller model monitoring it and then you just do a red team blue team game here where you train the policy to be really good at that.
- You then train the monitor on those samples to detect if this output is sabotaging or not. Then once you have this improved monitor, you retrain the policy to be more effective at undermining this improved monitor and you go back and forth and I think if you have a really good pipeline for doing that, that could potentially just output a really good yeah give you, give you a really good monitor that is less capable but can still catch subtle issues from your more capable model. So that would be an example of a general approach.
- I think that would be really useful for building, building a classifiers. - From my, from the stuff that I've done. maybe piggybacking off your idea before of understanding the the untrusted trusted gap or this protocol versus the thing that's being deployed and that helped us it meant that when because these failure modes weren't correlated, that the monitor was actually much better in this situation.
- Yeah we found basically an identical thing actually on our alignment evaluations. So the various generations of sonnet are surprisingly de-correlated. - Yeah. - Especially when trying to predict each other's failures which is both maybe not what you would've guessed and in a sense kind of useful for this control work, 'cause a lot of the most scary red team policies involve a lot of coordination which it turns out models just find pretty brutal.
- Yeah, so I'm just would love to people to explore this further right, 'cause if this is a general phenomena it'd be incredibly useful to understand are yeah working out which models are better for monitoring which ones aren't is one. And then the the other kind of open question I have is, and you kind of, you talked about this when you talked about untrusted monitoring where we can have a monitor which is actually the thing that we don't trust but because it's having to introduce an exploit and then it has to also notice the exploit
- when it's monitoring the thing then it's low probability of happening or I feel that's the main way of explaining that phenomenon of work of why it works. I think a lot of that work is only successful because at the moment the deceptive model doesn't know how many times it's been deployed at the moment.
- So it can't kind of guess when the right time is to coordinate copying its weights out or introducing a subtle book because it's trying really to keep that number really low so that it can just do it occasionally and get through monitoring and I'd love to see some control work that doesn't have this assumption that the red team or the untrusted model can't see stuff.
- = Yeah I mean I think there's this general dynamic you often find in control protocols when trying to tune the parameters, is that what you often care about is even a very small rate of failure can be quite bad. - Yeah. - And so both you care about the far tails of safety, the model, basically never being able to cause an egregious problem.
- Yeah - And simply the model if it's trying to cause a problem only he needs to get a success rate of not 0.1% or naught point naught 1%. - Yeah. - And so one of the things that I think we went along by playing these games is that the middles of the distribution of suspiciousness and harmfulness don't really matter. You really care about the tails here.
- Yeah I mean actually this is just a third point now which is I would love for better ways to evaluate the rare events or the rare occurrences than we currently do. - Yeah, well it's the obviously the consequence if you really care about the tails and you need an awful lot of samples. - Yeah, exactly.
- To be able to actually measure the quantities you care about in any detail and especially you if constructing those environments is really costly, that's that's the real challenge for this research. - Yeah, guarantee five nines of liability is actually incredibly difficult. - Yeah. - That would be my takeaway from control. - Especially if you're handwriting all the environments as I have been doing on some projects, you do not wanna be writing 10,000 data points yourself.
- It's fine. Claude will help us eventually, right? - Claude is helping a bit. Claude is helping a bit. - Yeah. Ethan do you have any particular lessons that you've learned from control that you know, you you've brought to up a part of your research? I think just we've learned five nines is really hard to , you know, guarantee. - Yeah let me think.
- I guess a lot of what's come up when we've worked on control I think has been just that the, it's helpful to have just frontier, access to frontier models to do a lot of this research. I think a lot of the threat models that we worry about are are models copying their weights out, that is the kind of thing that requires models to be doing multi-step tasks within a company coding environment.
- And I think we're sort of really pushing on in order to get to test on settings that we're really having to push on we're kind of at the frontier of model capabilities and even then it's not really able to do the models aren't able to do a lot of these tasks that effectively and very simple mitigations just checking the model with a less capable models will obviously just catch a lot of the behavior for some of these more sophisticated things.
- So I think, yeah I think my overall sense for a lot of these threat models has been that it's pretty difficult to pick both an interesting setting that's, but that's also kind of a real threat model that models can also do. And so at least for a lot of these settings it feels a little bit early to explore these but the persuasion business justification setting seems one of the settings that we have some signs of life on and building more data sets and evals is pretty helpful for creating more of these.
- Yeah I think that's interesting, the persuasion setting I think we're seeing signs of life on because fundamentally the thing a strategy that works very well for the model is just being generally a bit biased and it doesn't really have to think about that.
- I think they're kind of at an interesting point with respect to control research at the minute where models are just starting to become capable of the longer term more intended planning that might be needed to execute on more subtle sabotage policies. And so right now what we're seeing at the minute is for environments that look moderately realistic models are basically scoring zero at being able to do something subtle and actually achieve the goal but not get caught.
- But I think the thing that is stopping them from doing that is a planning capability that I expect models to get better at pretty rapidly and it wouldn't surprise me if in one year's time models are suddenly slightly scarily good at this and right now one of the things that I'm thinking hardest about is well how do we build the evaluations that are gonna really demonstrate that at the end of this year? - Yeah. - Yeah. I guess maybe this leads onto an interesting question of why do control now as opposed
- to the other alignment stuff. I feel you've, you've really gone in hard on the control paradigm. Yeah. - Yeah. I mean I guess maybe it's worth flushing out what the kind of end game is. I think, I think almost all people I've talked with, even people who are fans of control think that eventually we need to align models for sufficiently capable models.
- I think the key key reason being that it's hard to control something that's much more , that's just much smarter than you basically and you could do fancy pants stuff and make it so that you know you as your human review plus some augment some other trusted models can really be effective at checking the work of a really, really capable superhuman model but at some level of capability gap it seems to be probably it's just quite hard to have that much confidence that you're you're doing this effectively. - Yeah I mean people have been talking for years about the difficulty of keeping a super intelligence in a box.
- Yeah. - At some point in the limit control almost certainly breaks. - Yeah I think, I dunno, I've at least talked with one person who's , well maybe, you use the the super to monitor itself and there's ways to make it make that go well. So I guess there's still some at least non-zero discussion about this, but I think generally I think a lot of people are , well okay, the general strategy would be you control your maybe slightly superhuman system or at least human level system which is able to do lots of autonomous tasks including importantly AI safety research
- and AI alignment research, and then you have the model do a lot, a large amount of alignment research including meccas interpretability, you shore up your science, of how to evaluate whether models are aligned or not and then use that to develop better techniques for aligning models and also gaining confidence in in your alignment techniques.
- And then hopefully you yeah then then you're able to use those on your more more capable systems your superhuman systems and from there yeah I think you now you have a superhuman aligned system and then hopefully you just eventually solve the alignment problem just in general with the solution that works for all intelligence levels, but you might need to do this process a few times where you have your aligned superhuman model which then controls even more superhuman systems.
- You use that to do better alignment research and keep doing this until you have a more long-term solution or yeah. So something, something that would be kind of the the general longer term approach. - I do think the looking towards an end game, hopefully if we end up in that regime we can use models to actually do a lot of basic science, maybe a lot of the alignment science we need to do to align harder models.
- Maybe if we get into that regime and models are controlled but still showing signs of misalignment, we can at that point pause and actually start to study some of the really dangerous systems we're worried about. One of the big problems we have with alignment research at the minute is models can do bad stuff but they feel qualitatively different from the sort of misaligned transformative AI systems that I think we are all really worried about.
- So yeah, I think viewing that let's get to a system where models are economically transformative but are controlled as an intermediate goal, opens up a lot of tactics. - Yeah, I think that's right. I think an important point to make is that a huge amount of the benefits people are excited about and talk about maybe yeah almost all the benefits people talk about today are benefits you would get with effectively if you got an extremely, you know, extremely capable human replicated in an AI system or that level of capability you yeah
- you were able to get the world's best expert in every single domain that's still basically human level or maybe the combination is superhuman but at least there's one person in the world who could properly evaluate and replicate the behavior of the system and that already would be completely world changing is is maybe doable to control and it it is, it is possible basically the additional returns to intelligence.
- , it is possible that it is just much more unsafe, if we no longer able to control those systems, the risks become much larger at that point and it's not actually clear that additional intelligence beyond that point will have very large returns probably for some domains math.
- Sure probably will have pure math yeah, might have more returns but it's very unclear and efficiency may have returns but efficiency isn't necessarily going to make the model or that's not a, it's not becoming smarter unless you're doing something non-trivial. And so if we just run those intelligences really fast, I think we could get a huge amount of the value and then yeah I think use that to figure out what a better longer term solution is. maybe stay there for a while. Yeah.
- Yeah I think part of your question also was not just why work on control but why work on it now? - Yes. - And I think the elephant in the room there is that the AI field seems to be moving pretty quickly and I think a lot of us are feeling that while it would be nice to have a general solution to the alignment problem that scales to transformative AI and all the way to super intelligence, it's not clear how long we have to get that sort of solution and a control solution that got us into the transformative AI regime safely
- but didn't necessarily take us further might still be super valuable. Especially if we need something in the next, I don't know, two to three years. - Cool, so what are the fret models that you care about? Because I feel that's a really good way to , you know, frame alignment work. - One of the really key things about control is that yeah, there's kind of this hypothesis that if you guard against the key threat models then that's sufficient.
- And so you don't actually need to ensure that your model's doing nothing bad. You just need to list through what are the most major things that the model could do that would be really bad, block those reliably and then hopefully from there you're pretty safe to deploy, the main threat models that yeah, we've been thinking about Anthropic, it's possible there are more, but I think these are the most salient ones to us currently are models copying their weights out, models deploying themself within a company
- in an unmonitored way, and the third one would be sabotaging AI safety research. The reason the first two are important, the first two copying weights out of the data center and launching unmonitored copies of the model internally. Those are both important because we can then no longer, it becomes much more challenging or impossible to do yeah, monitor what the model is doing, block it from doing certain things, retrain it, delete it, shut it down, things that.
- If the model escapes and starts spinning up yeah versions of itself on cloud compute or other compute resource it's able to find then yeah then it's sort of very difficult to shut it down And then yeah, I think if it launches itself internally on the cluster on on some, yeah some internal cluster then I think that then it also becomes potentially also similarly difficult or maybe not, yeah, I don't know. It at least becomes difficult to catch that there's something going wrong.
- You maybe need to check the logs to understand is this a real job that someone launched or is this something that a rogue AI is doing? Maybe the rogue AI can then do unmonitored additional security research, research on how to then later escape or make some PRs which then enable it to do something else that's bad or additional things that are bad.
- So yeah, I think those, those are two of the key threats on the sort of unmonitored deployment side. Then there's another, yeah, I guess sabotaging safety research is the other threat and models, I mean already models are producing a large fraction of the code yeah surprising large fraction of the code that the world is producing.
- But yeah, also also including people are doing AI research with, with tools cursor or Copilot using LMs to generate the code and yeah pretty soon it seems pretty plausible that people use more agentic coding systems which are doing sort of multi-step coding, coding tasks writing code, running it, checking the results and repeating that loop.
- And with those systems we , yeah I think there's a kind of strong poll towards just using those to automate a lot of safety work and that the upside of that would be really high. We could get way more safety research done but also on the other hand if we don't trust the models they might actually sabotage that research, persuade us that of a wrong interpretation of some certain plot, persuade us to go down a diff, a wrong research direction, which is actually a rabbit hole and waste a lot of our time, persuades us that a certain model is safe, maybe even runs experiments to justify
- that the the model is safe and then gets us to deploy an actually unsafe model. So yeah, I think there's just a lot of risks related to yeah, sabotaging our understanding of the safety of models. So yeah, I think those are, yeah that's another, another key threat as well. - Yeah, there are other sketchy things that models could do.
- For example, they're deployed insert general security vulnerabilities that someone then from the outside could exploit or maybe not directly influencing our AI research but poisoning data for future models or persuading internal people or even external people at very important organizations about certain key decisions or doing kind of research helping people externally with AI research.
- Maybe if we're in a situation where we kind of, we would much prefer that AI research was happening at a small number of well-regulated or kind of well understood institutions instead model might kind of help people outside do a lot of AI research. That's another thing we might wanna monitor for but yeah I think roughly most all things that that we care about boil down to the three things you outlined or close to it.
- Scary future or scary risks that we should definitely mitigate or work towards mitigating. I wonder maybe to leave on an optimistic note what model developments do you think have happened or what has given you positive evidence that control will work or other alignment techniques will work in the future? - Yeah, well I think that one thing that's been maybe pretty optimistic recently is this trend towards models doing more and more externalized reasoning and people being able to get a lot of additional intelligence juice outta models
- by getting them to do these kind of long form reasoning kind of traces, and this is kind of great in a sense in that the models are putting their thoughts out there and you can read them and kind of assuming they're an accurate representation of what is going on, what the model's, actual reasons for doing stuff, and that's a huge surface area to be monitored.
- And I think if you're thinking about this from a control perspective, then the kind of questions you might ask are, okay, well suppose we put a model that uses a very long chain of thought into an environment where it has the opportunity to sabotage something and we let it try, firstly can it, can it use the chain of thought to do that task and well maybe it can't, in which case probably we're just not worried 'cause the model can't sabotage, but if it can then it seems pretty ly that the models are much better at doing this task with the long chain of thought than without.
- So in some sense that chain of thought is load bearing and if the chain of thought is load bearing then it seems pretty ly that actually there are going to be explicit references to the sabotage attempts in that chain of thought, you're gonna think of the converse, if that weren't the case then the model must be using the chain of thought for reasoning about how to sabotage but still managing not to say anything about sabotage in its chain of thought, and that's certainly in theory possible but in practice seems pretty unly,
- at least for models that have only just become capable of the sabotage and then we're not training by default to be able to obfuscate their chains of thought. - I think a massive winner is in Constitutional Classifiers, but the classifier can be so much smaller than the main model which is checking something I'm impressed at how small monitors can be now.
- Yeah that is a concrete win for monitoring that I think we're pretty hopeful will actually work in the real world. - Yeah. - And shows that these things are deployable in practice. Yeah, I think it's yet to be shown exactly how useful this is for misalignment type risks and whether we should worry about the monitoring the policy colluding or whether AI systems have correlated failures.
- But I do think that it's de-risked a big chunk of the technical risk for deploying monitors in practice. - Nice so control super important for the next two years and we're optimistic we can do it. Sound about right? - Oh. - Hope so. - Okay, nice. Thank you for watching this round table. We've been Anthropic, peace.
