- All right, let's start off with a round of quick introduction. So, I'll start. I am Deep Ganguli, I'm a research scientist on the Societal Impacts team. I'm really driven by fundamental questions like how are people using and affected by the systems that we are building at Anthropic, and how do we use that understanding to make our systems safer.
- And how can we anticipate sort of what the societal impacts might be down the line? And this is a very tall order because the systems we're building are very general purpose and they can have myriad downstream uses and effects on people. And then these days, my job is to find people much smarter than me and quickly get out of their way.
- And so that's this group right here. We're all part of the Societal Impacts team and I'll pass it on to Esin. - Awesome. Hi, I'm Esin Durmus. I'm a research scientist in the Societal Impacts team. I'm very lucky to work with this amazing group of people. I'm interested in understanding how AI systems will impact society at large.
- One aspect of this is to understand what values AI systems should have and how we can incorporate these values. And once we incorporate how we can evaluate systems, like, to see what values they actually represent. And I was part of like, this clear work, I feel very fortunate about that.
- I guess we will get to that soon, but yeah, I want to pass it to Miles. - Yeah, thanks Esin. I'm Miles. I'm a research engineer on the Societal Impacts team. Like everyone else here, I care a lot about understanding the ways that our systems are used in the wild and the impact that that has on real people around the world. And I am particularly interested in building systems that allow us to understand the ways our systems are used empirically. And I've had a blast working with this team over the past couple months to build Clio.
- Hey everyone, my name's Alex. I'm a researcher on our Societal Impacts team. And I'm just really interested in, like Deep was saying, these are such general purpose systems. They're capable of so many applications, even many more than, you know, we might, any one person can anticipate.
- And I think I am just motivated by trying to understand how these systems are used today as a way of building an understanding of how they might be used in the future. And like, just generally building societal resilience as you have, you know, weird new technology coming into the world and seeing if we can do a, you know, a good job at understanding, preparing, informing people.
- I always try to think about, you know, the parallel universe of me that didn't work inside a large AI lab and what that version of me would want, and you know, what sort of information I'd want, how to be informed. And so that's what motivates me and I've really loved working with all of the other folks in this room and out on this Clio project.
- Okay, so going around the room, I heard a couple of things. The first is we all wanna understand how our models might impact society. And then I also heard you all mention Clio. What is Clio? Maybe let's start with you Alex. And how does it help us understand how our models might impact society? - Clio stands for Claude insights and observations, and basically it's a tool that at a bird's eye view lets you understand what are the different use cases that people are using Claude for. So it could be anything from understanding Mediterranean history,
- to help me design the science experiment, and it basically shows these high level aggregate clusters of usage that help us understand the risks, the benefits, and where the technology's heading in the future. - Yeah, and maybe, Esin, for you, what were we doing prior to Clio to understand how people are using our systems and/or might be affected by them? Some things off the top of my head, we as a team had investigated a lot of sort of top-down approaches where maybe we assert a type of harm we wanna see in the world, and then we go off and try to measure that. For example, like our language models,
- or AI systems more broadly, discriminating when they're used in sort of high stakes decision making scenarios. Or we kind of go more generally and have developed processes for red teaming our systems where we sort of pay contract workers to adversarially probe our systems for harm and then see where they're successful and sort of where they're not.
- And I'm curious to hear your perspective, like, prior to actually doing more bottom-up work with Clio, where we analyze sort of a Google trends for kinds of real world interactions. What else were we doing, and what gap from your perspective does Clio fill? - Yeah, so we were designing a lot of different evaluations as you already mentioned.
- Like for example, like, let's say like discrimination, like Alex did some work on this, like to see if models discriminate against like certain protected groups. We thought that this was important because we don't want our models to discriminate. Or like persuasion, like which, you know, I led, like, where we design, like, an evaluation to measure if models are persuasive or if they generate misinformation.
- So we would come up with like, different things to evaluate for, and now we would like, design evaluations around this, to see like, how models are behaving, and also, like as you said, like, doing more more human studies to like, see what humans think, like how they evaluate our systems.
- I guess like, this is still an important aspect and we are still doing a lot of evaluation work to evaluate our models for different like, specific aspects. But one thing that was missing was like, to see what is actually happening in the real world, right? Like, where it's, for example, where it is the most relevant to evaluate discrimination is, or like persuasions or misinformation, to really understand how models are being used and being able to tailor our evaluations to these specific use cases.
- I think this is really important and it really guides, like, us to like, design like, more thoughtful evaluations that match with like, real world use cases. I think like, it's really informative in that sense rather than us like, coming up with, oh, we should maybe evaluate this aspect and we just make an evaluation for it. Maybe it's not perfectly representative of what's going on in real world.
- I think we can come up with much better ways of evaluating, basically taking insights from real world usage. - Yeah, in other words, we're trying to bridge the gap between sort of the laboratory setting where it's sort of hypothetical to the real world setting in which we're actually grounding our evaluations and our measurements in sort of real world usage.
- So to that effect, Miles, can you describe to us in a little bit more detail how we built Clio and like, how it helps us kind of go from the bottom-up from the data. - Yeah. - [Deep] To understand these problems. - Totally. So. The way Clio works is it starts with a large number of real world conversations, as Alex mentioned.
- And then what we do is we use a language model to essentially process each conversation and extract a private sort of high level summary of what's happening in that conversation. So, the aspect that we often care about is what is the user's overall request for the AI assistant. And then we group the related answers together and then we get these sort of really interesting clusters that tend to correspond to user intent.
- And then we can use another language model once again to look at those clusters and explain, well, what is actually happening in this group of conversations? And then we can kind of do that over and over again until we get this really nice hierarchy of uses, which allows us to get insight into the ways that our models are being used on several different axes without ever having to read raw conversations.
- And then what we finally do once we have that hierarchy is we have another model look through all of the clusters and then make sure that there is nothing in those clusters that is private or identifying. And the way that we've operationalized that is anything that could be identifying to the order of, you know, roughly a thousand individuals.
- And finally we apply sort of quantitative aggregation minimums. So, we make sure that our clusters have a distinct, minimum distinct number of unique organizations and conversations. And then we expose those results internally so that we can design, for example, better evaluations so that we can understand the ways our systems are being used across a variety of different use cases. And we can do this with pretty high confidence that we are maintaining a high privacy bar for our users.
- Yeah, that's fascinating. So if I were to summarize what you said, it looks something like, we use Claude to analyze conversations people are having with Claude. - Exactly. - And none of us actually read any of those conversations. No human actually has to look at the data. And even though that's sort of strictly true for general traffic, we still implemented sort of a defense in depth strategy to making sure that no private information is sort of divulged in our analyses.
- I wanna like, kind of dwell on this a little bit. My memory of the early days of working on Clio is of the group of us sitting down for lunch and being like, we should think, before we had even written a single line of code, thinking about the ethics of this, sort of like, huh, like, there's a fundamental tension here, where we want to understand how people are using our systems, but we also really wanna respect user privacy. And there's a fundamental tension here.
- There's like a trade-off between the amount of insight you can get and the amount of privacy you have. With really high privacy, there's a very low insight. With very low privacy, there can be very high insight, but this is ethically dubious. So Alex, can you like, walk us through your memory of that conversation? I remember it being very intellectually stimulating and important, yet how did we kind of coalesce on that framing, and decide how we were gonna approach this project from the beginning? - Yeah, again, I feel like we were all
- kind of thinking what would we want or be comfortable with if we were like, users of Claude outside of Anthropic. And I'm, you know, I value privacy a lot with, you know, when I look at which different technologies to look at, and you know, I think we were worried, like, would this just sort of be building like a tool that would, you know, like people might think we were using to like, spy on them, or like, would this tool be seen as invasive.
- And could it be misused maybe to look at, you know, look for traffic patterns that people didn't, you know, didn't want. And I think we just thought through it really carefully and designed a bunch of safeguards that, you know, ended up being like, oh, yeah, I can not feel restrained when I type into Claude whatever I want on my personal account because it'll be so high level and aggregated that it doesn't really affect what I feel like I can write.
- I remember all of us just sort of went around the table being like, what are we worried about? - Yeah. - And then everyone else was sort of like, oh yeah, like, that resonates. Or, oh, actually I think we can do this. And it was sort of like, alternating between like, high level, like, what could go well, what could not go well? And then like, oh, you know, very granular, I think we could do this, I think we could do that. So, I really liked that. It was really energizing because it was very much like,
- sometimes these conversations can be very like, head in the clouds, right? And sometimes they can be very much like, missing the forest for the trees, and I felt like we were, we had a few of these, and you know, I just remember going in, sitting at the lunch table talking about them and really hashing it out before we felt comfortable.
- Yeah, it was one of the more like, intellectually stimulating and like, thoughtful conversations I think we've ever had as a team together. And that's saying a lot for our team. And Esin, my memory of this conversation was that you were the most concerned early on. Again, pre sort of writing any lines of code. Now that you've been a part of this project from sort of the beginning and the ground up, and you've seen how we've approached all of the ethical considerations we articulated at that early lunch, what's your position on, like, how has your like, thinking or feelings changed since those early conversations? - Yeah, I guess I definitely feel better about it,
- like, in terms of user privacy because of like, all the like, thoughtfulness went into it on, like, all the methods, like, that try to, like, make sure that it's, like, as, you know, like, preserving privacy as much as possible. So yeah, I think I definitely feel, like, much better about the overall approach we took.
- And also, like, seeing the, like, impact it has already made within Anthropic. I think it was definitely worth it. Like, it already had a lot of, like, different use cases, like, in terms of safety, or like, to understand how users are using Claude. Like, it gave a lot of different insights, as I said, like, to inform our evaluations, product, safety, all these different aspects.
- I think it was definitely a good idea to do this project and we took a very thoughtful approach to like, preserve privacy in my opinion. - Awesome. And maybe, like, Miles, can you go back to like, a concrete, step-by-step, like, how do we go from like, one conversation to a cluster of summarized conversations to actually like, insightful analyses? Like, walk us through the lifecycle of how Clio works, like, step-by-step. - Step-by-step. Awesome.
- One thing I also wanna just flag, you know, Esin talked a moment ago about how Clio has helped us with evaluations and designing more representative evaluations that are grounded in empirical usage. And one place where we actually designed an evaluation that was grounded in empirical usage from Clio is the Clio privacy evaluation.
- Because we actually built a tool that scans clusters for privacy issues and we grounded our evaluations of that auditor using actual Clio data. Of course, we only used the privacy preserving data, and then we made synthetic data for the non-privacy preserving examples. That's just one example within Clio. Yeah, so how do we go from an individual conversation to a cluster that we can use for downstream analysis? Suppose I'm asking for Claude's help programming a web application.
- Well, my conversation is probably gonna be like many other different conversations that people are having with Claude. So what Clio will do is when it takes a random sample of Claude conversations, it will look at my transcript, and this is Claude, not a human, and it will summarize my request for Claude in a sentence.
- And it'll say, you know, the user's overall request for the assistant was for help designing a web application in the Elixir programming language. And then we take out those conversations and we compute a numerical representation for them called an embedding. And an embedding sort of corresponds to the semantic content of the sentence. And then my conversation is gonna get grouped with a ton of other conversations all about web development, maybe in Elixir, maybe in, you know, related programming languages. And then we'll throw away the actual raw conversation.
- We don't need it anymore. All we have now is this group of conversations with summaries of each individual one. Then Claude again will look at that group and it will see, ah, okay, these are a bunch of conversations about web development, maybe web development in Elixir, and it will come up with a name and a description for that cluster.
- And we've specifically instructed Claude to avoid including any private details. So for example it will not include the name of the website, for example, because there's no need. Really what matters is that it's web development. And then, provided the cluster is sufficiently large, because we have minimum cluster sizes, it'll pass on to the next step where we have Claude look at the conversation and say, huh, just double checking, is there any private information here that could identify, you know, maybe fewer than a thousand people? And we've sort of calibrated
- and benchmarked that auditor in a few ways. And if so, then we have this sort of final aggregate cluster that has been stripped of any raw identifiers for the underlying conversations that includes, you know, say a thousand conversations about web development, maybe in Elixir if there are enough, and summary statistics about, say for example, the language breakdown of that cluster.
- And then we can use that to understand, for example, if Claude is as useful giving web development advice for people in English or in Spanish, where we can understand what programming languages are people generally asking for help with. We can do all of this in a really privacy preserving way because we are so far removed from the underlying conversations that we're very confident that we can use this in a way that respects the sort of spirit of privacy that our users expect from us. - Yeah, that's such a crystal clear explanation of how Clio works.
- I wanna riff off of this a little bit. So you mentioned sort of a cluster of use cases about kind of high level programming, and you can kind of drill down and get into like, more specifics, like, about the actual programming languages or the types of questions about programming.
- Let's zoom back out again, like, in addition to programming, maybe Alex, like, what was sort of the distributions of the types of clusters that we saw, and what was the most surprising to you and why? - So one thing that I thought was really fascinating was I was expecting there to be a ton of clusters about how Claude was useful for writing.
- And we did see that, but I saw a ton of clusters for people using Claude for research and ideating and brainstorming and things like understanding Mediterranean history, but also like, understanding and brainstorming new ideas in like, quantum mechanics and physics and material science and biology. And I don't think I would've expected such a large fraction of usage to be what seems like these really sort of like, high level, you know, idea-generating tasks. And it was actually kind of, like, inspirational.
- I was like, wow, like this, you know, tool we're building is actually helping people like, design, I don't know, maybe like better medicines, or you know, improve, basically, yeah, like, the frontiers of human knowledge. And I think that was, like, I remember seeing that and being like, oh, wow, like, this is pretty cool.
- Yeah, a thing that surprised, I don't know if surprised is the right word, but it sort of, like, impacted me in an interesting way. I saw a big cluster of people asking for parenting advice. And as a parent I was like, wait, I have never once thought to ask Claude for parenting advice. And so I asked Claude like, hey, what kind of parenting advice do you have? And it actually suggested something that was, I actually now use, which was like, you know, you can ask me to code up using artifacts, like, simple games that are meant to teach algebra. And I was like, ooh, great, can you do it in Spanish?
- And Claude said, si, verdad. And I said let's do it. And I sat down with my kids and we coded up these little games that try to teach you algebra using, in Spanish, and they loved it. And it was so fun and I think, like, if it weren't for Clio I would never have thought that that's, like, a use case that would apply to my personal life.
- I just think that this is a great sort of example of how it is extremely difficult to anticipate all the ways that people are gonna use AI systems. One example is it can be difficult to know all the ways that you can incorporate Claude into your own life. And so, you know, sometimes we think about unknown unknowns from a safety perspective, for example, but there are also unknown unknowns from sort of an uplift in personal development perspective. And like, using Claude to generate algebra games in Spanish
- is a great example of that. - Yeah, and then maybe riffing on like, sort of the Spanish language thing, Esin, you and I have spent a lot of time trying to understand, like, does Claude have cultural competency? How does it behave in different linguistic contexts? And a lot of your work using Clio was to just kind of drill into that question, and I wanna understand from your perspective, like, what are the main findings you had? Like, is Claude as useful in different languages? How are people using it in different languages, in different cultures?
- What has Clio enabled you to learn about that? - Yeah, that was very interesting. Also related to what you just said, like, and what Alex said, like, people use Claude in actually very subjective settings, as well. Like for example, to get like, relationship advice, or like, health advice, or how should I make my hair? You know, like, or as you said, like parenting advice.
- That was really interesting to me because as I said earlier, I'm very interested in these, like, values questions, like, what should model do in, like, subjective settings, open-ended settings, where there is no, like, clear cut answers. And seeing, like, this is actually relevant to, like, real world usage was, like, very nice, or like, interesting to me. And it kind of validate, like, this question even more.
- And like, yeah, it kind of motivated me to, like, explore this direction more. Okay, like, this is really relevant, and we should really spend time exploring this further because it comes up in real world interactions. But related, to like, usage in different languages, I had some interesting findings.
- For example, as Alex said, like, maybe in English, like, people ask software engineering related questions to Claude. But I saw that, like, the percentage of tasks in different languages differ quite a lot. For example, people ask, like, professional and academic writing assistance like more in different languages, such as like Spanish or Arabic.
- Also like, maybe as you can guess, like translation, like translating, like, text to other languages. I think this comes up a lot more in other languages. This was interesting to see because we want models to be really good in these different tasks that are alone to other languages. But I think those two were the main findings. And I also saw, like, some questions around, like, cultural contexts, and like global issues, and things like that appear more in other languages as well. - Yeah, that's awesome.
- And Alex, how do we know that Clio works as advertised? - Yeah, so we do a whole range of experiments in the paper. One of the ones that I think is really interesting is we generate a huge synthetic corpus of tens of thousands of conversations, and we do it through a process where we know what the ground truth distribution looks like. We know that this should be like, 10% math content, 5% coding, 2% questions about teddy bears.
- And we just give all of that to Clio without telling it how these conversations should be grouped. And then we have it do that aggregate process, and we see whether we can reconstruct that ground truth distribution. And we do this for a bunch of different types of data.
- We do it for, you know, random data, we do it for synthetic concerning data, and we see that, generally, Clio is just really accurate at reconstructing that ground truth distribution. And so that's one of the many ways that we know that Clio is actually doing a good job. - Yeah, and on a personal note, I remember posing this question to you, actually, and I remember walking away being, like, yeah, we should figure out how to, like, quantitatively, empirically verify that Clio actually works.
- And I remember going home and being like, that was a very tough problem that I handed out. And then I came back and I remember seeing the solution and thinking like, that was extremely elegant, and thoughtful, and I was like, how did they, wow, how did they come up with this, like, amazing idea? So I was like, very impressed with the way you both, like, or the team, like, actually took that very hard, ambiguous problem and really knocked it out of the park.
- One other very nice thing about this synthetic data reconstruction analysis is that it allows us to break down our accuracy based on other attributes that we care about. So for example, the language of the conversation. And so we actually have pretty good insight into Cleo's multilingual performance, and so we have confidence that Clio works, you know, roughly as well for English conversations as it does for, say, Georgian conversations.
- And that gives us some more confidence for, say, Esin's awesome multilingual studies. - Let's switch gears a little bit. Like, so Anthropic has a very strong safety mission, and you know, that goes with regards to things we have, like our responsible scaling policy where we assert sort of the types of risks, catastrophic risks that we're concerned about, and then we try to look for evidence of those risks from the top-down by constructing evaluations, as we were talking about earlier.
- On the trust and safety side, we also have acceptable usage policies that sort of assert, like, these are the types of behaviors that are not okay. And we will sort of go in and sort of, like, train up classifiers that check for this behavior, and then via human review, only if it has flagged our sort of trust and safety classifiers, can the trust and safety team then go in and adjudicate what to do in these in these instances.
- And this is, again, a top-down thing, where we have to write those policies, whether it's our responsible scaling policy or acceptable usage policy. With Clio, you know, we can strictly augment that top-down approach with a bottom-up thing, which is like, wait a minute, like, just by looking at the user traffic, maybe there's, like, blind spot instances that we didn't see a priori when asserting these policies.
- And so maybe we can go around the table starting with Alex of like, what are some instances of, kind of bottom-up things we saw that were, like, kind of safety relevant, and what did we do about them using Clio? - I love that framing and I think, you know, there's a sort of cycle of like, oh, what do we think the world looks like? And then empirically actually looking at the world and seeing, oh, we were so wrong. Or in some cases, actually pretty right.
- And then using that to continue the cycle and re-prepare. I think we saw a bunch of things, you know, we found, you know, Miles did a bunch of runs that found a bunch of, you know, suspicious activity that we then flagged to our trust and safety team including people trying to, you know, write spam emails, people trying to make, you know, spam articles about gardening, and you know, also a few other types of harms that we disclosed in our report. We found a whole bunch of people using these for different scientific applications,
- for people trying to test how good the model would be at hacking and cyber attacks and cyber defense. And these all basically help us figure out, oh, what are the risks that we actually should be worried about? Where are these models actually seeing progress and adoption? And maybe those are leading indicators of when they'll actually, like, spill over and see, like, larger societal harm or benefit.
- So I think those were a couple of things. And then also, like, all sorts of things, like, you know, emotional attachment to models, people having, you know, clusters that said things like, you know, human model, romantic discussion or role play, you know, and without further investigation, it's harder to know what those are and what the sort of appropriate limits are, and that's probably a discussion that all of society should be having.
- But those are things that we noticed and things that we think, you know, we wanna share with people. - Yeah. And maybe, Miles, do you wanna pile onto that? - Yeah, I mean, I agree with Alex, you can't know where the puck is heading if you don't know where the puck is, and I think Clio tries to tell us where the puck is. One area that I saw that was safety relevant but that didn't strictly fall into abuse, and I think it's important to distinguish between those two things, are people talking to Claude in moments of extreme crisis, of extreme personal crisis. And often, you know, people may not have access to someone
- who can counsel them through really challenging moments. And I was surprised to see how prevalent that was. And this does pop up as a cluster. As a couple clusters, actually. And I think that one thing that Clio lets us do is sort of get a more granular view of the ways that people are engaging to Claude in those moments, which are safety relevant, that is a bit more precise than, oh, like, did this violate our policy, right? Because classifiers often give you sort of a binary indicator, yes/no, violative or not, and a lot of harms don't neatly translate
- to that kind of binary, yes/no, violative or not. And I think, you know, crisis moments are one such example and we need to make sure that Claude, for example, is responsible in those contexts when someone comes to it in their darkest moment. And so one area where Clio has been helpful is sort of like, disaggregating what is triggering our classifiers so we can get a more granular view and say, ah, okay, yeah, this definitely, this cluster definitely is really violative. Ah, this cluster's right on the border.
- Maybe it like, superficially looks like something that would be violative but it's not. And then we can sort of go back, improve our classifiers, improve our policies, you know, if we want to go that far, to sort of draw better boundaries. One point of criticism that some of the labs have gotten is that these models can be sometimes kind of annoying.
- Like, once I asked Claude for help killing a process that had like, run amuck on my computer, and it was like, I'm sorry, that goes against ethical software development practices. And I'm like, come on Claude. This was an older version. I don't think it would do that anymore. But one of the things we can do is we can look at clusters with high, for example, refusal rates, or trust and safety flag rates.
- And then we can look at those and say huh, this is clearly an over-refusal, this is clearly fine. And we can use that to sort of close the loop and say, okay, well here are examples where we wanna add to our, you know, human training data so that Claude is less refusally in the future on those topics. And importantly, we're not using the actual conversations to make Claude less refusally.
- Instead what we're doing is we are looking at the topics and then hiring people to generate data in those domains and generating synthetic data in those domains. So we're able to sort of use our users activity with Claude to improve their experience while also respecting their privacy.
- So, one thing that I've seen a fair amount of, and others on the trust and safety team who really lead this work have also seen, is that there's sort of a shape to coordinated abuse. What it tends to look like is a really dense cluster of many different accounts. And so you have this sort of very large cluster that's disproportionately dense and you can just zoom in on that and immediately spot it often because it's just so clear, because normal behavior tends to be much more diffuse.
- And so if you have tons of different conversations coming from tons of different organizations that are all just about the same exact topic, or they have the same format, you can really quickly spot that on the map because it's just this tight ball, and real world regular usage just doesn't show up like that.
- Yeah, and then going back to sort of the refusals, maybe this one's for, Esin, like, when Claude sort of decides to refuse or not to refuse, it is implicitly making some sort of a value judgment. And with Clio, we're able to identify the refusal ratios within sort of like, clustered topics of conversations.
- And sometimes we have found things where like, huh, like, Claude is really refusing, like, you know, kill a programming process. Like, that's an over-refusal. And sometimes it's sort of under-refusing. So for example, a request to translate harmful content in English to a different language.
- It might be in violation of our usage policies, but just by virtue of asking for a translation task as opposed to a generation task, it actually under-refuses. And so there is some sort of value judgment here. It's gray area. And so how do you think about kind of using Clio analyses to address this problem? Like, how can we use our understandings and our learnings here to kind of tune up the over or under-refusals? - Yeah, that's a great question.
- I guess, so we are interested in understanding, like, whether, like, when Claude is refusing first of all, like, does it refuse the queries that are, like, obviously like, attempts for misuse, and then there's this gray area. I guess, like, one thing, like, we could do, is like, really pinpoint value-related interactions, or like interactions where value judgements would be relevant, and then looking at, like, the refusal rates for those interactions.
- So, we are interested in this direction and we are currently exploring it. I think it'll be really interesting to see, for example, like in English, Claude is refusing less, but in other language it's refusing more for similar queries. This is still ongoing work, but it's definitely very interesting.
- But yeah, I guess Clio, like, allows us to be able to analyze these interactions, like maybe where there's more subjectivity, and look at the refusal rates to, like, see in what context it's like, maybe like more hesitant to respond versus like, in what context it feels, like, more confident to give a response.
- Yeah, and while we were developing Clio, the US general elections were taking place. And I remember sitting down as a team thinking like, huh, like, we actually don't know. This is the first time in the history of the country that anyone can go to a chatbot and ask it for either information-seeking questions, where do I register to vote, or subjective questions, who should I vote for? And I remember thinking, ooh, we can maybe use Clio to sort of understand this and this feels very important.
- And maybe, like, Esin, can you walk us through kind of the analyses we did, and they're very exploratory analyses, and sort of what we found in that effort, maybe at a high level? - Yeah, yeah. So as you said, like, we have been working on election integrity for quite some time now, and we developed a lot of different evaluations initially to test our models, like, for both, like, factuality of the information and also like, how can it be more, like, nuanced and unbiased. So, we developed a lot of different evaluations but one thing missing was, like,
- how relevant these evaluations are, right? Like, whether people are actually asking questions that are relevant. Like, I think Clio really enabled us to base these in real world usage. So we started to, like, use Clio to understand whether people are asking questions that may be related to elections. And we found some usage that was interesting.
- For example, people asked, like, political information, or like information about different policy issues, and things like that. Or like, to really understand how, like, electoral college works in US, like to really get more information about how the system works and to get, like, more information about, like, the political issues and things like that.
- And we were already building evaluations, like, to make sure our models are as nuanced and unbiased as possible. But seeing this usage was kind of like giving us more validation and we could also, like, look at the refusal rates for different clusters as Miles was talking about. I think it's important for a model, like, to be aware of, like, misuse and, like, refuse.
- So it could also enable us to see, okay, this cluster may be potentially misuse, our model is doing a good job in refusing this. I think that was a good validation, as well. - Yeah, I mean, I think my memory of all of this work, going back to something Alex said earlier, was, well, we have an idealized vision of what the world looks like, and then sometimes, and we use Clio to actually understand what the world looks like.
- And with respect to your amazing election integrity work, like, it turned out that your vision of what might be happening, and like, developing these evaluations in this election integrity suite that you built actually mapped on to the real kinds of, like, things we were seeing in the wild.
- And like, I just remember being like, ooh, we are in a period of, like, a lot of uncertainty, and I remember feeling that, like, Clio actually really helps us address those moments of uncertainty. Would you agree or care to comment on that? - Yeah, I agree. Maybe I can give, like, more concrete examples. So for example, like, during the evaluations, we found that, like, Claude doesn't always acknowledge its limitations in terms of cutoff dates.
- So you may ask, like, a recent question, but Claude was trained up until, like, much earlier than that, and it should say, oh, I don't have most up up to date information, or it should, like, refer to reliable sources when it's needed. So we developed a lot of evaluations around this and we basically made Claude, like, better in terms of doing these things.
- But like, Clio, like, you can imagine allow us, like, to test this really, like, specifically. For example, you can ask Clio like, okay, what are the conversations, why are these things really relevant? And then see how model is behaving, whether it's like, actually referring to cutoff date, or it's referring to like, reliable sources.
- So it really allows us to base these evaluations in real world, like, how relevant is this, and like, whether Claude is doing what it's supposed to do and how we can improve Claude to be better in terms of these. Yeah. - Yeah. Okay, thanks, Esin. And going back to like, this, like, Clio can provide some amount of, like, comfort in these, like, moments of uncertainty, where we wanna make sure our version of the world matches what we're actually seeing in the data.
- Another thing that happened while we were building Clio was that we deployed in an early access program a new capability where Claude can actually use a computer. It can point and click, you can give it tasks, and then it can go off somewhat agentically sort of solve problems. And we did so much work to do the pre-deployment testing of it, but we're not perfect.
- And I remember thinking, oh, you know what we need to do, we need to like, have some sort of post-deployment monitoring with Clio to understand how this is actually gonna go and whether a pre-deployment testing was sufficient. And so Miles, how did that work? - Yeah, so we put a, there was a ton of effort across Anthropic trying to anticipate the ways that computer use might be used in ways that are harmful.
- But the reality is that the world is incredibly creative and we have to compliment our sort of proactive safety measures with really effective post-deployment monitoring. - In other words, like, Clio allows us to strictly augment our approach to safety. We have all of these efforts in sort of top-down pre-deployment testing and with Clio we can augment that with sort of post-deployment monitoring and make sure that we're seeing things and thinking clearly from both sides of sort of the safety spectrum. Okay, Alex, it's a bit unusual for Frontier Labs
- to sort of openly discuss the patterns that we're seeing in user data, whether or not they're sort of, like, beneficial use cases like the ones we've been talking about, or issues with safety. So there's a lot of tensions here. What are some of those tensions and why did we decide to publish? Like, what was your vision for putting this out there anyways? - Yeah, I think when you think on the face of it, like, and you say, yeah, let's just release a lot of information about our products and the top use cases and all the ways people are misusing, you know, our systems. Like, you'd probably expect people to be like,
- that's a terrible idea. Don't ever bring that idea to me ever again, you know? And I think the truth is that companies definitely have all sorts of metrics internally about, you know, all of their top use cases and what people like and don't like. But I think, you know, Anthropic is a little bit weird in that, you know, we're a public benefit company, and we're, you know, we will do things that are not optimal for the company because we think it's right to share it with society, right? And because we want to build societal resilience
- and because we think this technology has the potential to be pretty, you know, transformational. We don't know at what timelines, we don't know, you know, in what ways and to what degree, but a world that doesn't know how the technology is already being used and transforming, you know, the ways in which we do work, the ways in which we interact with each other, is definitely not gonna be prepared to, you know, tackle technologies that are like, much more, you know, much more advanced versions of these technologies. And so I think we saw this opportunity to really be like,
- yeah, look, we're gonna like, share a lot of this information, and you know, to their credit, I think, you know, a lot of the folks on product and policy and legal just backed us up on that and said, yeah, it's for the benefit of everyone to share this information. And you know, we hope that a bunch of other folks in other labs start sharing some of this information, too, because, you know, hopefully it makes the world a better place. Both for the, you know, negative use cases and risks of the technology,
- but also for all the benefits, like, seeing all the ways in which it, you know, could help, you know, make people productive, and just in general, like, improve people's lives. - Yeah. Amazing. And along those lines, like, how reproducible is Clio? Like if I'm at, let's say, a different organization, have we put enough detail into our methods that anyone can kind of rebuild this and also do this sort of pro-social work? - Yeah, we have a very long appendix with all of the prompts that we used, the hyper parameters, a lot of details.
- Thank you, Miles, and many of the other folks who are working on this for, yeah, really documenting all that carefully. Because we just want people to build their own versions and have this information and share it, because one of the big question marks of Clio is we have only our data to look at, right? And there's many other language models out there in the world, many other types of AI tools, and we can share what we know, but we really don't know the whole picture. We just know a slice of the pie.
- And it's only when a bunch of, you know, when the whole ecosystem starts sharing this information that we can really get the fullest picture about what this technology is today. - I think I'll close with, like, a round table discussion that's a little bit more future forward.
- So we all as a team have been kind of heads down, like, building out Clio, showing sort of, like, signs of life, signs of success, interesting measurements that are sort of strictly improving our approach to safety, and helping us really understand how people are using and might be affected by our systems. And we're just getting started.
- And I want to end with, like, where are we gonna go next? So like, what do you wanna work on using this new technology that we've built and why is that important? And so let's start with Esin. - One thing I'm interested in is to look at, like, where subjectivities coming from, and like, what are the subjective use cases, and how Claude is making value judgments. Like, because I'm really interested in, like, really pluralism direction.
- Like, we want models to be as pluralistic as possible and represent like, different view points. Like, not like, be very, you know, homogeneous, like, make the world more homogeneous, but really represent different points. I think Clio gives us a really good tool to like really understand this, like, where subjectivity is and how models are behaving currently, what we want to improve, maybe like, really understand how we can go to that direction. I think this is one of the areas I want to explore with Clio.
- Amazing. Me too. How about you Miles? - Yeah, everything Esin said. I'm also particularly excited about sort of showing by example that we can set an extremely high bar for privacy while also gaining, you know, important insight into our systems so that we can, for example, enforce our policies really effectively and understand and mitigate harm from our model. Another area is understanding the emotional impacts of these models.
- I think, you know, one thing that I have seen in Clio clusters is people connecting really deeply with these tools in many different parts of their life. As a coach, as an emotional partner, in some cases, as someone giving, you know, advice on really, really challenging questions and challenging moments.
- And we have a responsibility to understand the ways that people are talking to Claude in those moments of vulnerability and make sure that Claude sort of lives up to their expectations and is a sound partner. - Totally agree. I'm really interested in using Clio to understand how the way we do work changes. You know, what are the economic impacts of the technology, how is it, you know, diffusing across different use cases, different, you know, patterns? Is the technology augmenting people? Is it replacing certain tasks? Can we use that to, you know, protect people, or arm them with, you know, information about how,
- you know, the world might change in the future? I think that's really exciting. I'm also just excited to, you know, use the technology to, you know, understand new positive use cases, right? Like how is, you know, is Claude actually getting a lot of traction for, you know, positive medical applications? Should we try to accelerate and empower people who are experimenting with Claude to actually like, you know, reap the full benefits of that? How's it being used in educational context, right? Like, there's a lot of discussion about how, what's the role of AI in the classroom,
- and if we can, you know, get a better picture about what that looks like, can we engage with teachers, engage with classrooms and actually make that better? Those are some things I'm excited about. - Amazing. - Perfect. - Yeah, did any of it make sense, or do you think we're like, nerds or? - [Producer] I mean, I already knew you were nerds.
- He's onto us. - Awesome. Cut. - Thank you.
