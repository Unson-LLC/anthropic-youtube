- Customers are coming to us because they want AI that is honest. They want AI they can trust. We want partners who have a shared sense of where we're going. A shared mission, shared values, shared collaboration towards a unified goal. With Anthropic, it's been true since day one that we are marching in the same direction.
- What people want is they want to do strategic work, they want to do meaningful work, they want to do the joyful work. This is what everyone craves, and Asana helps people get a quick picture of that and have confidence that they're doing the right things, prioritizing the correct work, and that they know what needs to happen by when.
- 80% of the Fortune 100 use Asana to drive clarity and accountability at scale. We have more than a hundred thousand companies across the world using Asana today. We started at what are the tasks and projects and ways you can have line of sight into who's doing what by when. We added on why. And so now we have support for goals, OKRs and goal management as a core part of Asana.
- We have always had a very ambitious destination, and the path to get there in terms of the technology and tools, we knew would evolve along the way. And so when we saw how AI was catching up to our appetite, the things that had previously been a sparkle in our eye were there. They were a prototype away. The most effective way to use AI is to have it in context in the work you're already doing, not redefining how you work, not figuring out how to program or change everything from first principles.
- If this is in the context of how you're already working and your processes, you can kind of just treat this like a teammate or an extension of your existing teammates. Some of our most successful features to date that use Claude are kind of centered around what we're calling organizational intelligence, which is, how do we take your work or how you interact with your teammates and extract insights or higher level themes from that? We found Claude's models particularly good at reading between the lines and understanding the health of the initiatives
- or what's actually happening between the words that are said and then writing it in a way that is easily digestible and easily actionable. We also have features which let you extract any insight you want. What is the key decision that was made recently, or what are blockers that you need to know of? Now we can use Claude to identify these themes, bring them up to the right people, and create action from there.
- Asana has been part of three early access programs with Anthropic. These have caused us to get really close with the product research team, understanding where the model's going, what do we wish could happen, and applying our evaluation benchmarking that our customers have shown us what's important to them in terms of what kind of reliability they want, what does good look like.
- Running betas with our customers, where we partner with them directly to discover the use cases that matter most, gets us into a place where they are able to invent new ways of using AI. What's really cool about AI in the last year is we're able to do things that we thought weren't going to be achievable with a five-person team or in six months or in a year.
- We really catalyzed how far and how fast we can build features to help our customers.
