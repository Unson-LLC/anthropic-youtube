- this is just a simple prompt to turn Sonet into a dialogue agent that will talk with you in a language that you're trying to learn so I chose Spanish and I wanted it to basically take my imperfect Spanish and and help me improve it um so I decided I wanted it to do a few things I wanted it to take my message which will be in kind of imperfect Spanish um and write out what it thinks I intended in English I then ask it to write back the ideal learner message which is just my message as it kind of should have been written in Spanish so I can see the
- kind of Ideal form of this uh then I ask it to write a teacher response which just a response to me in Spanish uh so that I can continue the conversation great so this is basically just Sonet saying that we're ready to start so I'll just start with a simple first message and here it's following the format that I asked for so it's repeating the message that I tried to send it back to me in English it's telling me how I should have said it so it's corrected some of the grammar issues in my request um and then it's
- responded to me in Spanish and then it's asked me uh where I'm from so okay now imagine I don't know a certain word in Spanish but I still want to say it I'm going to just include that word in English in square brackets and hopefully it will just translate it back to me and suppose I hit a roadblock because I just don't understand the message that it's sent to me I can just ask it to translate that message to me into English and then I can read that and I can respond to it again in Spanish continuing the dialogue and as a final step you could
- ask Sonet to create a little quiz for you based on the things that you've been discussing so hopefully that is a useful prompt if you're interested in using Sonet as a language learning partner I hope you try it
