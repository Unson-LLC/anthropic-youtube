- Today we are announcing our Team plan. What we've launched today sets the stage for how you collaborate, not just with Claude, but with your entire team. Let's say you work in marketing at EdTech, an e-learning platform for businesses to create and deliver online training for their employees. You're launching a major product soon and you need to jumpstart your marketing plan.
- Claude has access to your audience personas, your creative guidance and style guide, and the channels you use for marketing product launches. We'll add a product spec here that outlines the key functionality and value propositions of this upcoming feature. Claude will take this shared knowledge across documents from different teams and co-create this brief with me.
- First, let's ask Claude to come up with a plan for how I should come up with my proposed launch strategy to make sure I'm not missing anything. This list looks good. Let's start with our first artifact. I need to identify our top 50 customers as they are our target audience. Think of an artifact as a work product you might share with a colleague.
- It writes the code, I run it, and now I can upload this list to the project as well. In the future, you can imagine that Claude is directly integrated into your database so that you don't need to run this offline in another tool. Now, let's ask Claude to create an overview of our launch strategy. Based on previous performance, it can propose launch goals, target audiences, and channel strategy. Perfect.
- Now let's ask Claude to write some proposed copy for each of our main channels, taking into account our style guide and past channel performance for a launch brief. This artifact is looking good. Since this space is shared with my collaborators, Sandy and Whitney, I can ask them to check it out. Soon, multiple people could be in this chat together and collaborating directly with me on this artifact.
- Today, we're excited to share the first step towards this new paradigm with the Team plan. We can't wait to see what you build with Claude.
