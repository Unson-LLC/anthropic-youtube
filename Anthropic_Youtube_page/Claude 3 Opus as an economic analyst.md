- in this video we're going to see if Claude and a couple of friends can help us analyze the world economy in a matter of minutes okay I've asked Claude 3 Opus which is the largest model in anthropics new Claude 3 family to look at the GDP trends for the US and write down a markdown table of what it sees we've given Opus and all the other models in the clae 3 family extensive training on tool use and one of the major tools it's using is this web view tool it goes to a URL looks at what's on the page and because it's multimodal it can use the
- information on that page to solve complex problems so here's the markdown and it's important to note that CLA doesn't have direct access to these numbers it's literally looking at the same browser you and I are seeing looking at the trend line and trying to estimate what the exact numbers are let's see how accurate it was we've asked the model to create a plot of the data and it's used the second tool this python interpreter to write out the code and then render the image for us to check and here's the image look it's
- actually added helpful little tool tip animations to explain some of the major Peaks and troughs in the last decade or two of the US economy and we can compare that graph with the actual data and it turns out it's pretty close it's actually within 5% accuracy and by the way claud's transcription here isn't just coming from its pre-existing knowledge of US GDP we tried it with a large sample of madeup GDP graphs and its transcription accuracy was within 11% on average next we asked the model to do some statistical analysis projecting out
- into the future performing simulations to see where the GDP of the US might head and we can see that it's run this analysis using Python and it's able to perform these Monte Carlo simulations to see what the range of GDP possibilities might look like for the next decade or so but I wonder if we can go further we're going to get the model to analyze a more complicated question that is how GDP might change across all of the biggest world economies and then to help it do that we're going to give it one more tool called dispatch sub agents
- this basically allows the model to break down the problem into lots of sub problems and then write prompts for other versions of itself to help pick out the slack the models can then complete a more complex task by all working together here you can see it's written this prompt and given very precise instructions that it wants the other models to follow including a format for the data that it's hoping to return it's dispatched a version of this prompt to one model that's going to look at the US one for China One for Germany
- Japan and so on we can see in these progress bars that the sub agent models are now completing the set task for each of the individual economies they're going to the relevant web pages they're getting the information they're running the code to analyze it just like we saw in the previous US example but all in parallel let's just skip forward to see what the model produced you can see it's run the analysis it's produced a pre- and post pie chart of how it expects the world economy to look in 2030 versus 2020 and it's given us a written
- analysis too where it makes variable predictions that relate to the statistical analysis that it ran it's telling us that it thinks the GDP share of particular economies will change and which ones will be larger or smaller by 2030 so there we have it complex multi-step multimodal analysis run by a model that can create sub agents to get even more tasks running in parallel we're excited to see what you our customers can do with these Advanced Claude 3 capabilities
