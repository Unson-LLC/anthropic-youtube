- [Music] my name is Richard Robinson I'm the CEO and founder of Robin AI our mission is to make contracts simple for everyone in the world using artificial intelligence so in the past if you received a contract that somebody wanted you to sign a lawyer would have to read every single sentence of the document to screen it for risks and then change each sentence to the comma to reflect their negotiating position and actually that process would happen two three four sometimes five times backwards and forwards the average contract takes
- about 60 days from beginning to sign and what our technology does with the help of Claude is it massively accelerates the time it takes to get that process done for making this process 8 to 10 times faster the reason we've been working so closely with anthropic and we chose to integrate their llm into our technology stack was we really love D the anthropic Mission and focus on safety in the legal space it's important to our users that they're using systems that they perceive to be secure trustworthy and safe and we were really
- confident that anthropics mission was aligned to that and it the Claude model really reflected that honestly Safety and Security and trust these are actually the most important things to our users you could show them a truly magical piece of technology but if they didn't have confidence that it would keep their data secure that they were working with a trusted party then honestly you wouldn't be able to convince anybody to use it it's bad if we get things wrong and so the standards are really high we've used Claude to
- help build our AI Persona Robin and use that as a co-pilot where lawyers can work with AI alongside their contract workflows and actually the Amazon bedrock which allows us to have a effectively a private version of Claude that gives customers tremendous confidence that their data is only going where they want it to and we don't think we could sell nearly as much if we weren't able to give that Assurance which with many other model providers we couldn't my dream is that one day everybody will use our system to help
- them with their legal problems our systems are being designed to help people with every legal problem they could ever face using the most intelligent artificial intelligence those available combined with deep understanding of the legal industry
