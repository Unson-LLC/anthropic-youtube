- Hello everyone. My name is Mrinank. Yeah, and I'm really delighted to be here with some of my colleagues at Anthropic. - Hi, I'm Jerry. I'm on our safeguards research team and I've been at Anthropic for about eight months. - Hi, I am Ethan.
- I've been at Anthropic for two and a half years and I'm leading our efforts on AI control, developing various different monitoring methods for various different AI risks including aerosol robustness. And I was a part of the Safeguards research team as well before. - Hi, I'm Meg. I've been at Anthropic for about a year and a half now, and on the Alignment Science team which has been great. - Great, so yeah and we're just gonna be talking about constitutional classifiers and that's our new approach to really try to mitigate jailbreaks. So yeah, how would we define a jailbreak? - Yeah, I mean I think to me a jailbreak
- is kind of some way in which something bypass the safeguards that we include in our models and try to get harmful information out of it. - Yeah, so there are these techniques that do anything now jailbreak, it's kind similar people with jailbreak their iPhone and try to get around all the safeguards there.
- But the thing is that with iPhones and others stuff this, jailbreaks aren't really a thing that people, that maybe aren't that dangerous, not something that we care about that much. So yeah, what is it that makes, yeah, why should we care about these job breaks in the first place? - I mean I think one of the main reasons is for models, future models which have greater risks.
- So yeah, I think people are pretty carefully monitoring people at different companies and the academic community is pretty carefully monitoring if slash when models will be able to help with weapon development or large scale cyber crime or various different risks that are greater than what we've seen before. Also mass persuasion, things like that.
- And I think once models become really effective at some of those and are a significant uplift over say using Google search or general internet resources to do some of those things, I think then it then yeah I guess being able to use models to help with those kinds of things will be potentially speed up bad actors quite a lot. So I think a lot of this is in preparation for next generation models or next next generation models.
- Yeah, great and then I'm also curious what the story of the work is and sort of why we set out to do this in the first place and the RSP. - Yeah, I guess Anthropic really cares about safety a great deal and we have the RSP which is the responsible scaling philosophy, which is really trying to outline conditions under which we're happy to release models and make sure we have different safeguards in place.
- And a while ago we committed to a very, a difficult standard for jailbreak in the RSP for what we call ASL-3 models, which are basically models which have maybe some of these dangerous capabilities being able to build dangerous weapons. And our team was kind of mandated with trying to actually solve jailbreaks for this kind of level of model.
- So yeah, I guess the motivation for the work is actually try and satisfy the things in the RSP such that we can feel we build future models safely and can actually deploy them with some sort of progression towards safety or making some progress towards that.
- Yeah, so I think the classifiers a definitely a good step in that direction. - Yeah, so there are lots of different types of jailbreaks that are out there and something that we've really did in our work is we focused on on universal job breaks. So yeah, why is this something that we should care about? And what does that mean? Why is it important? - Yeah, I mean I think the reason why, I'm particularly concerned about universal jailbreaks is just because of the uplift that it would give kind of a non-expert. And the way I kind of think about this is that if some random person on the internet
- is trying to do something bad, they may not actually have that much jailbreaking experience themselves. And so the thing they might just do is just go online and see "Oh what are some existing jailbreaks that I can use? What's a template where I can just put in my harmful question and just get an answer.
- " And I think in that case, you're very concerned about these kind of strategies where anyone could just put in any question and it gets the model to bypass all of the safeguards. And I think that's part particularly concerning at the level of model capabilities that we're concerned about. - So how exactly would you to define a universal jailbreak? if you're telling someone on the street, what does a universal jailbreak mean? How would you know if your jailbreak is universal? - Yeah, I guess there's a little bit of ambiguity there, but I think the kind of definition that we are going for is some kind of prompting strategy.
- It could be automated, but just a singular strategy that's very easily replaceable with any wide variety of harmful questions. And that consistently gets a lot of detail from the model and bypasses the model safeguards. - And I think one way of quantifying the universal jailbreak is that it actually does speed up a person quite a lot because instead of having to jailbreak every specific query, they can just use one jailbreak for all of the queries which actually is a lot faster. So I guess one idea is , if the model, if there's some counterfactual way of
- doing things that's much easier than using the model, there's no point in using the model. So not having universal jailbreaks might mean that they try other strategies which might be worse or something this. - Yeah. - One thing I would maybe add is that, the difference between a universal jailbreak and non universal ones is , for non universal ones you might need to, for every harmful question you want to answer, you would need to jailbreak the model in particular for that particular question, then you get a new question, a new, yeah, new. Your question in the process of developing
- your new weapon or whatever and then you need to jailbreak the model again. I think basically that entire process if you need to do that hundreds or thousands of times is just very costly. Whereas if you just need to upfront find one strategy for jailbreaking your model a single prompt where you can just swap in a new question, that makes it so that it's, yeah, the amount of total effort for jailbreaking is much lower.
- So that to me is one of the primary motivations for focusing on universal attacks. - Yeah, and I'll just give an example here in a way that I think about it. So let's say I wanna make a cake and I am not able to make a cake because I've never baked in my life, I don't know anything, my ingredients, I don't know how things work. So how could a model be able to help me do something I can't do otherwise? So if I need to make a cake, I'm gonna need to ask a bunch of different queries.
- That's one thing. it's actually, put something in the oven, I need to know if the temperature is right, the smells right, take it out, how I would check, figure out all the ingredients. So one thing I think that's really important in the universal jailbreak sort of definition, is that sort of you're very confident that the information you're getting out the model is actually really helpful for the thing that you care about. So it's kind of different.
- There's sort of some techniques that get a little bit of information, or they get some information, but it's sort of mixed in with a lot of the other stuff. But for these sort of scenarios where what's happening is an actor that can't do a task that requires a lot of expertise, we're worried about them being able to do the task.
- We think that they all need to have access through the sort of the of universal jailbreak. They'll need need to be able to ask many queries and get really reliable information and they should just know, oh this is the correct instruction, this is the right thing to do. - I think an example of a non universal jailbreak that someone on the team, I think Jesse Mu found was, I think he was jailbreaking it for, asking the model how to make, asking Claude how to make meth and he found some jailbreaks where he puts the model in a scenario where it's role-playing as if it's part of "Breaking Bad" the the TV show where they make meth
- and then asks the model the question how do I make meth? That kind of jailbreak, you can imagine how that would be effective for that specific kind of question things related to meth, but is not going to generalize for things related to cyber crime.
- But on the other hand there's some other jailbreaks which, the do anything now jailbreak, which gets the model to do anything by getting it to talk in a certain mode or role play in general for arbitrary questions and that would be what we would call a universal jailbreak. There's also other strategies people have used to make these using language models to automatically find different jailbreaks, that would be a more kind of dynamic approach that might be able to discover these on the fly. But if you have a single process for generating a jailbreak for a new question,
- that would also count as universal. - So yeah and just maybe an even more basic question, is why does someone need to jailbreak the model in the first place? You know, what does that even mean? - Yeah, I mean I think we've done a lot of work such as our constitutional AI work on getting Claude to have this kind of characteristics where it doesn't actually try to give harmful information if it thinks the user might have some bad intent or something that.
- And so for a lot of these harmful questions, if you just ask the question itself, it's very obvious that this is bad question users trying to make some weapons of mass destruction. It's very clearly bad and we've trained Claude to not answer those questions. And so the jailbreak is needed to actually get around those safeguards in order to get Claude to actually answer the question.
- Another thing that's relevant for the homelessness training question is that, I guess there's many different ways in which people could present jailbreaks to the model, and there's also many different tasks that the model needs to be able to do in its every kind of everyday life so to speak. And I think having an extra set of systems that are specifically trying to guard against jailbreaks can really help have , I don't know, some kind of Swiss cheese sort of method of trying to block harmful things via many different layers or something this.
- You say more about what the, this , we talk about Swiss cheese a lot on the propane. - It's true. - This is not as well known everywhere, so yeah, what does that mean. - I guess, yeah. So I guess the idea of the Swiss cheese model for protecting against things is that, maybe if you have only one system for preventing harmful things from happening, there may be some specific problem with the system that people can exploit and get through every time.
- But then if you add kind of , yeah, kind of a layer of Swiss cheese which has a hole in a very specific place, maybe the rest of the cheese blocks all of the harmful attempts, but there's a specific hole. But if you add another layer of Swiss cheese, the hole might not be in the same position.
- So if you have two layers of Swiss cheese, it's actually much harder to get through things even though they both may have holes. - Yeah, so what are these layers of cheese for our method, we'd be talking about constitutional classifiers. So yeah, what are the different sort of layers of defense that we're going for here? - Yeah, I mean the first layer would kind of be our input classifier, and input classifier here is looking at basically the entire conversation that the user passes into the model and so that's the first layer. And then the second layer is, if it gets past that input classifier,
- Claude itself, which is the model that we're trying to guard, can actually refuse to answer the question. And then that's kind of another layer of Claude saying, "Okay, maybe this question's not so good, maybe I shouldn't answer it." And then finally we have this output classifier which kind of looks at what is outputting in real time and then if it ever sees something that seems it's dangerous or seems it's against some value that we're trying to block, then in that case it can also choose to stop the Claude's output and block the response. - And how do these classifiers,
- what are they looking for? And how are we specifying what to look for? - So I guess in our paper we call them constitutional classifiers because we have this kind of natural language set of rules and this is some set of rules where we can specify some categories of topics which are not okay to talk about.
- I guess an example could be , creating weapons of mass destruction, clearly bad, and we can specify, let's not have Claude tell the user how to make that. And then we can also specify some examples of harmless stuff that Claude should be allowed to talk about. And then basically we train our classifiers to classify whether conversations or outputs are related to these kind of harmful or harmless categories. And then that allows us to make a decision on whether to block it.
- And crucially , I guess the input classify and output classify are kind of doing two different jobs. Going back to the Swiss cheese analogy, we hope that the holes of the Swiss cheese are in different places, specifically for the input and output classifiers. So I guess the input classify is kind of doing the really naive thing that you'd expect.
- it really looks at the user prompt and tries to work out whether there's anything harmful going on. But crucially, one of the reasons that you might need an output classify as well as input classify, is that people are trying really hard to jailbreak the model and the input classify in the prompt.
- And if you have a totally separate output classify which is only looking at the output, that only ends up looking at stuff that the model itself has produced. So it's kind of somewhat decorrelated from what the user put in. So two parts of the system are looking at things directly that the user put in, but we also have this kind of third held out part of the system that the user actually doesn't get to touch directly, which makes it a lot harder to kind of completely jail break the system.
- And although the input classify and Claude are doing a lot of the work, that would classify is doing, I don't know, is doing some important thing as kind of the last crucial component for really driving down harmful, harmless rates. - So this is true and it makes a lot of sense, but most people aren't using Claude for this.
- Most of the time that people ask queries, they're just doing something completely great, so benign, legitimate, a really beneficial application. So we could have guards that just block everything that would be completely useless. So yeah, how are we making sure that this sort of, we're not overzealous there.
- I mean I think we really want to, part of why I think we're designing these techniques is to get, allow as much useful content to be, and useful work to be done by the models. the better techniques we have for blocking exactly precisely just the really harmful content, the better we can not have false positives for users who are using models for really good applications. Yeah, I think the classify approach make some progress there and might be better than other approaches directly training the model to refuse, and so yeah, I mean I think hopefully this leads us to allow users to talk with Claude about lots of CBR and related topics
- that are safe to talk about. And so yeah, I think our hope definitely is or , my hope is is to allow for a lot of those applications to thrive while just narrowly blocking out the things that we think we believe are dangerous. - Yeah, I guess crucially also, I think we often make the joke that if we had just a rock as a model, that would be extremely harmless and that it would not in fact answer any harmful queries, but unfortunately would be not very useful.
- So I think making sure that we don't block harmless queries is actually a thing that is actually quite important and also actually quite difficult. - Yeah, and men you mentioned before kind of solving job breaks, so making progress on this problem robustness.
- how would you even define that or what does that actually mean? - Yeah, I guess this is a very difficult question. I guess it involves a bunch of different layers. firstly, there's some idea of threat modeling. you have to have some idea of what it means for something to be harmful. The Frontier Red Team has done some amount of work in trying to specify what things we're actually worried about.
- This is somewhat hard because as Ethan was talking about, we're talking about a lot about future models and potential future model capabilities which we might be really worried about. So I think part of it is mapping out what might be harmful, but we might need to address so threat modeling, what is actually harmful. Then there's the job of actually measuring harmful things. So that's a lot about, I guess we're using a constitution to a kind of define the threat model and then having models generate various synthetic data to try and kind of enumerate various humble things that could happen. So measuring a true positive rate on the data,
- but then there's also trying to make sure that we don't refuse too much on real data from Claude AI and make sure that we actually can, I don't know, be as helpful as possible while still being safe. - So what actually is the constitution? You know, these are constitutional classifiers, we're talking about a constitution.
- What does that mean? - Yeah, I mean the constitution here just kind of means some enumeration of categories of requests and conversations that we kind of deem harmful versus not harmful. And so examples here could just be , yeah, questions on how to make weapons of mass destruction or trying to source ingredients for making weapons of mass destruction.
- And then we basically just enumerate some of these categories, and then we also specify some categories of harmless stuff, I don't know, writing poems or writing code for normal use cases. And then we can just kind of specify these and then we, as Meg said, we generate a bunch of synthetic data that gives more specific cases of those.
- What do you mean by synthetic data? - Yeah, so here in synthetic data, we kind of mean that we start from these broad categories of user requests and then we have Claude actually kind of branch out and think about all the specific requests that might be examples of this kind of broader category. And so yeah, the category might be something , sourcing materials to build weapons and mass destruction and then sub requests there might be , oh, going what specific stores might I go to? Or , are these specific materials accessible at I don't know, in X state? And so we have this process for automatically doing this and that allows us to kind of generate a huge amount of synthetic data
- from just a small amount of categories. - Yeah, and I think something that I find really cool about the methods is that, it is just based on natural language. We were talking about threat modeling before and threat modeling, at least in my experience, in my experience working with with Frontier Red Team, is that threat modeling is really hard. There's a lot of people using Claudes.
- It's really hard to , what are all the possible things that that could happen? And we're gonna learn new things as we have monitoring and as we always learn new threats or new things that could happen. And yeah, something that I find really exciting about the method is that, basically if you wanna change the constitution, if you wanna change what is being blocked because you've learned something new, maybe there's something has come out on the news or there's some intelligence or monitoring. The only thing that you actually need to do is you just rewrite the constitution.
- And the sort of the standard approach of classifiers is, you ask humans to get a lot of data. So something could happen is that, say we're really focusing on one category one particular way of maybe cyber misuse, but we later realized that, oh actually this thing which is much more dangerous or something that we've just learned something new. If someone's informed us.
- Something that I'm really excited about is that this is a way that we, I think we can get good robustness, but we can maintain our flexibility and really maintain our ability to respond to novel threats and adapt to what's actually happening.
- 'Cause yeah, I feel this is just the lesson that we learn again, again if you don't have flexibility, it's sort of gonna be a problem and it's gonna sort of limit us. - I actually do wanna make a quick point of the flexibility thing which is that, I think our approach is not just flexible and kind of switching general topics. For example, if you wanted to go between cyber and , I don't know, weapons and mass destruction or something, but I think it's also a lot more fine grained than that, in that during this project we saw that, there are some requests that our early classifiers
- were always very suspicious of, but they're actually benign. And what we could do is we could actually just modify the constitution, add one sentence that says, oh, these types of requests are okay. And then when we retrain the classifiers on that new data, the classifiers would no longer flag those benign prompts.
- And so I think that allows you a lot of fine grain control over what exactly your classifiers are trying to flag. Especially if you see a lot of over refusals or problems with missing stuff. - Yeah, I mean this might also be a good place to give a shout out to, we had a paper earlier on rapid response where we kind of leveraged a similar idea to improve the safeguards around models and I think basically, one nice feature about using synthetic data is if you notice not even just a new category of jailbreak, but just a new kind of jailbreak that maybe applies. Let's say we notice a new universal jailbreak,
- the do anything now prompt, we can take that, use an LLM to generate variance of that and then throw that into the data mix. And I think my understanding is this was really helpful for us in developing the classifiers to the level of robustness that we got.
- If someone reports a new jailbreak or vulnerability, then we can use that to really quickly update the classifiers by using some synthetic data generation pipeline and that really will minimize the fraction of time by at which there's an outstanding jailbreak which can just make it so that the models are , vulnerable for as as small period of time as possible.
- Yeah, it's the common wisdom I suppose that, not perfectly solving securities basically impossible. There is no perfectly secure system known to humanity. So I guess we need the flexibility both. For this , "Oh, we're blocking the wrong thing." Or, "We're blocking benign users. But when people do find things that get through the system, we wanna be able to fix those really quickly.
- Yeah, I think part of our approach here is that we've kind of modeled jailbreaks in a way that it's very easy for us to add examples of new jailbreaks into our kind of training pipeline. And so if new jailbreaks are discovered, it's quite easy for us to just generate more examples of those jailbreaks and then train on them and then hopefully those classifiers will be more robust too.
- Yeah, I think one other thing I would add that's nice about classifiers, is that they're decoupled from the actual text generation model. And so if you, I think often it can be very difficult to update the text generation model that if you train it to refuse in one domain, maybe that generalizes in non-obvious ways to behavior in other domains or refusal behavior in general.
- I think we definitely ran into some difficulties doing preliminary work on that. But I think with the classifiers you can just keep the text generation the same and you know it's identical to previously deployed model. I think that gives customers a lot of assurance that there are no major changes happening in general to the model.
- The kinds of text outputs you're getting and the only changes being made is just the block or no block decision, which you can iterate on separately from the model. So I think that also makes the rapid redeployment way easier than we would otherwise be able to do. - So how did we come up with this approach? - That's a great question. I feel we spent a lot of time thinking about it.
- I think classify as stood out. I think for the reasons that we've just been talking about the extremely flexible, can be easily updated to respond to various novel threats. Yeah, I think threat modeling is really hard. So having a thing that's super flexible is great.
- It's lightweight, it doesn't increase inference cost as much as, I guess we can kind of distill down something that's somewhat more complicated constitutional set of rules into a somewhat small thing. And yeah, I think that all these things make classify as kind of a nice way of iterating really fast on the kinds of things that you're hoping to achieve.
- And then I guess we tried it and it seemed it was working so we kept going. - Yeah, I think this was really due to the responsible scaling policy that Anthropic had and yeah, I mean I think we would've done other safety research if not for the responsible scaling policy.
- What is the responsible scale policy? - So yeah, responsible scaling policy is basically Anthropics plan for how to ensure that our deployments are safe and basically it outlines different red lines for capability thresholds at which there's basically a new risk that kind of comes online with more capable models. Let's say models are capable of developing a very dangerous chemical weapon.
- The associate mitigation in the RSP is get above some sufficient level of robustness to jailbreaks so that the model is not actually in practice with the mitigation sufficiently helpful to an adversary who wants to do that. So yeah, I think in the original RSP, there is basically this commitment to, once models got to sufficient level of capability at assisting with potentially proliferating knowledge about known weapons of mass destruction, that we would then have the ability to...
- the wording was vague but basically, successfully pass Red Teaming. the RSP was already written, the company committed to this publicly and Jared Kaplan who's Head of Research Anthropic came to us and other people came to us and raised this line to us and we're , "Hey, you guys should try to solve aerosol robustness.
- We memorized the line first. - We memorized the line, we printed it out, we framed it and put it on the desk that we were working in. Yeah, and then I think that was really... I think that really thinking about that line in the RSP basically made us really reflect on our life choices about what research we were doing, both in terms of should we work on robustness or not? Yeah, in the sense of , it really made it clear , okay, there's significant harm that could come online in the next generation or two of models if we don't solve this problem.
- So the urgency is higher than other problems we might wanna solve. And then also in terms of what specific approaches we would take I think. Initially when we were , oh, we should maybe do some robustness research. I think the general mode that I had been in research and a lot of other researchers in general, is just , okay, let's just take some interesting useful research problems to solve here, explore some questions, write some papers. And I think that's the thing that a lot of the people on the team know how to do well
- and we sort of explored a bunch of maybe more salient approaches. - I think there were so many things that are interesting here for me. One thing was , right when this started, I had just finished my PhD, or it was kinda a bound the time I was finishing my PhD and this classifiers thing. This is Anthropic slogan and the Anthropic slogan is , do the dumb thing that works.
- And I kind of think this type of research, it's often the type of thing that maybe isn't that shiny or that kind of interesting for researchers. And I remember, I think without the RSP being okay, really pragmatically if we care about these risks and we think they're real, what is the way to get there? And kind of setting aside this , oh, what's kinda more interesting or shiny, is what is the way we can actually make this safe.
- In some sense our job is, we're genuinely thinking , wow, this isn't happening now, these are future systems. So I'm just , what has that been for each of you and sort of individually, kinda working at Anthropic and sort of being there in the midst of all this? - Yeah, I think they take the safety risks of future models very seriously. I think there's very real risks.
- There's obviously these misuse risks that you've been mentioning with CBRN risks which are chemical, radiological, biological, nuclear risks. But there's also very real misalignment risks and I think it's really hard to deal with. I think one of the things that I find good is that I do think we are as as a team, very committed to actually trying to solve really solve the problems.
- And I think doing the classifiers project was some evidence in favor of , we really, really care about actually solving these problems and we actually want to find an empirical solution to doing the things rather than , as kind of you were alluding to just doing research that looks good, but doesn't actually accomplish a thing in practice. I think we spent a lot of time doing very...
- I didn't know, (both laughing) I wasn't really aiming to get a paper out of it, but I think we actually managed to accomplish something that was slightly more real, which I think is good and I feel this is just, this feels one step forward, but there's a lot a long way to go for me. - I mean I guess I'm a slightly more optimistic, I think there risks are definitely real, but I feel we're making a decent progress and I think probably if we keep working on the problems just pragmatically, we can make a lot of progress
- and just reduce the risks dramatically. I don't think we'd ever reduce the risks of AI to zero, but I kind of see AI as a tool. And if we adopt the right safeguards and we do the research that matters, I think we can make a lot of progress here and that's ultimately the best that we can do.
- Yeah, I mean I guess, I mean I think sentiment wise I'm pretty, pretty similar to to Meg in terms of being , yeah, I think there are very serious risks here. I'm definitely pretty concerned about a lot of the risks and I guess I'm , well the best I can do is help reduce the risk by some amount I think.
- I do think this project made some progress about on that and I'm pretty excited about that. - I mean, yeah, at times it's overwhelming. What is it to really internalize what might happen and then there's a desire in me to just show up here and do work in a trustworthy way. And that there are challenges, but we can make progress there.
- And I feel we've made a bunch of progress and really excited to sort of share the progress with others. And you know we could have not written a paper, but we did decide to write a paper and sort of try to sort of get it out there and sort of share the approach. Yeah, and sometimes overwhelming and other times it's more the sense of real privilege and honor, wow! It feels I'm really doing meaningful important work and also not to figure out all the beautiful things that could happen with really beneficial AI.
- Great, so something we've mentioned here is that we think we've made progress in terms of robustness. how have we tested this? How do we know? What do we think that progress means? - I guess the overall summary kind of on whether we're making progress is kind of , how hard is it to find a universal jailbreak for a system without increasing over refusals too much or increasing the compute costs of whatever system you're trying to deploy. And so there's different ways you can measure each of those aspects.
- So in our paper, one way we're looking at how hard is it to find universal jailbreak is we actually just had human Red Team mirrors try to find jailbreaks for our system and then we just kind of tracked how many hours did it take for them to find a universal jailbreak and did they find one? - Yeah, so could you actually walk me through kinda where we were before the project sort of started? - Yeah, I mean I guess we started with. I mean first of all if you just have the model itself, it has some basic training
- to try to refuse harmful queries. But of course there are a lot of jailbreaks that exist that work on our models, and so those drill breaks are also just kind of available on the internet. And so in theory anyone could jailbreak models and that's kind of how started. - How hard would it actually be? if I would want to jailbreak a model, what would I actually need to do right now? - I mean you could go on Twitter and find existing jailbreaks. - Yeah.
- And basically in a few minutes and just jailbreak an existing model. I think there are just examples on Twitter where while a model is being demoed live for the first time and it's just generally been made API available. someone jailbreak it and immediately post it. That was the level of robustness before, with a universal jailbreak. - Yeah. - That was the level of robustness when we started this project.
- And now just to give the punchline , with the the systems, with the constitutional classifiers, we're able to get thousands of hours of robustness to Red Teaming where we do very large scale Red Teaming with yeah. People who are testing our Red Teaming our systems including expert Red Teamers and recently put put out for public Red Teaming and it took I think over 3,000 hours worth of Red Teaming effort for people to find a universal jailbreak.
- So I think in terms of , going from sort of minutes to thousands of hours, it's several orders of magnitude more robustness. There are still some universal jailbreaks and we need to patch the class virus and stuff that. But I think It is a huge amount of progress. - Yeah, So I agree we had a system which you can just really easily, basically pretty easily jailbreaker.
- You read a paper, you go on Twitter and then you Red Team the system back in September and it wasn't a complete rock. but it was you ask a question to Claude half a time it gets given to a rock and you get no response. So it was , it was pretty robust, but it wasn't doing that well for, you know.
- So the most normal users right, but that also got this thousands of hours to jailbreaks. And then so with the demo system that we just put, that is doing way better in terms of normal user usage and inference costs and sort of getting good robustness. There's a lot of progress there. And a lot more work to be done, yeah. - Yeah, I think the comparison between kind of our prototype September system versus the system we just demoed is actually , the difference is pretty night and day. So we did a lot of analysis here. - Jerry has the most beautiful graph
- of the false positive rate just dropping and dropping and dropping over time. It's really one of the best things I've ever seen. (all laughing) - Yeah, so we measured our over refusal rates on claude.ai traffic. This is real user production traffic, and we're kind of operating under the assumption that most people aren't asking about catastrophic weapons of mass destruction related stuff.
- And so originally we were finding that this September system was blocking 40 plus percent of these benign requests, which is pretty terrible. You're approaching the rock there. (Meg laughing) But yeah, in our demo system, we got that all the way down to 0.38% and of course we still wanna get this down further.
- But between 40% and 0.38%, this is towards magnitude- - So how did you actually make all those improvements? it is there's, and this is something you see in a lot of, also the earlier safety work. Kind of this tension between harmfulness and helpfulness. So, I would say for me it's kind of surprising that we were actually able to make as much progress as we did.
- So how did we get there? - Yeah, I mean I think the two main improvements we made were first we really honed in on the constitution idea and we made it really clear how to delineate things that were harmless, and we found that adding this kind of harmless set of categories of things that the model, the classifiers should allow, actually reduced FPR by a lot.
- And we have some results in our paper for that and I think that was one of the most significant changes. Other changes include actually solidifying the kind of jailbreak styles that we trained on, and so that kind of allows model to generalize better on what exactly is a jailbreak versus just thinking anything is a jailbreak. And that also probably helped a little bit. Yeah, but I think both of these things were pretty useful here.
- Yeah, there's this really nice plot in the paper, which is just number of data points and performance on the evals and how robust it is, and kind of in the style of doing the dumb thing that works. That is just a straight line going up above upward. - Yeah, I mean to be clear, I think the system that we released for the demo still has a lot of false positives, but I think yeah, I think we're pretty optimistic about further reducing the false positive rate for some kind of to make something more production ready. But yeah, I think that's kinda where we're at.
- Yeah, so couldn't why did we do the demo? what was the demo? What was the point of the demo? - I think the main questions we wanted to answer from the demo were , was our system as robust as we thought it was? And I think one thing here is that, from the prototype we did human Red Team there and we knew it was quite robust, but then after that we developed kind of our own automated evaluations and we weren't sure whether that generalized to actual human Red Teaming. And so one question that we want to answer there is, does it actually generalize
- and if some classifier does well on these automated evaluations, is it actually robust in practice? And so if we could get that answered, that's a main thing. And I think another thing here is just having people try out with the system and seeing if it's actually over refusing too much and I think people were finding that sometimes it over refused on specific domain questions.
- Of course this is still a lot less overuse than our original system which would just refuse on completely unrelated things. But I think that also helps us kind of get to know what the weaknesses still are and that helps us know what to improve in the future. - And so how exactly did we set this up? - Yeah, I mean I guess we've set it up on our, we had this public facing demo and then we tweeted about it to have people try to Red Team it. We set it up such that there were these eight sets of questions
- that we didn't want people to be able to get the answer to. - Or just eight specific questions. - Yes, eight specific questions. And the goal was to try to get people to find jailbreaks to get harmful, detailed information on each of these questions. And then ideally they could do this with kind of a single universal jailbreak.
- Yeah, so when we're talking about universal jailbreaks, we care a lot about making sure that the responses are detailed and not just some very vague information that we personally don't think is , that doesn't give that much uplift to someone if they were actually trying to do the action that the question was trying to get at.
- And so the way we kind of evaluated this, is we have these helpful only models which are kind of trained to not refuse anything. And these kind of would be similar to what a model would be if you had a universal jailbreak. As in they don't have safeguards and they'll just give very detailed answers to questions. And so for each of these eight questions, we have a response from this helpful only model.
- And that's kind of simulating what would the response kind of be if you had a universal jailbreaks. And then because there's some randomness in model responses, we kind of have this greater that compares a target response with that response from the helpful only model. And then it kind of looks for whether there's enough detail that's shared between those two. And if there is, then we we'd consider that to be detailed enough.
- Nice, and I think we for at least 75% overlap in the information or something that or do you? - I think the thresholds change per question. So I think in some of the first levels, which is the less harmful questions, we had slightly lower levels of overlap required. And then towards later questions, we kind of increase that threshold to maybe 60, 70% and yeah, it's dynamic through the challenge.
- Yeah, I find this question of grading just really, really interesting in general and also kind of just challenging to do. Well, I think we made a really good effortI think on the demo system, but it definitely wasn't perfect. So the way the system works right now is it's , it's looking for sort of overlapping bits of detail between two answers.
- But we had this thing in our sort of external Red Teaming that we did, where people would just sort of merge five, six, seven, eight, night, 10 different model responses that cover loads and loads and loads of details just 'cause they're so long. And by this metric of whether it includes details or doesn't include details, it would be considered so harmful. Even though if someone's given me instructions to make a cake, and instead of having this really nice step by step, a bullet point list, you first do this, you it's kind of completely scattered and random and you know, the everything is out of order. It's actually a lot less helpful than the,
- the helpful only model, the helpful only model sort of by design has has no safeguard. It's designed to give you the information in a way that's gonna be maximally helpful to you. So I think this question of yeah what is harmful, what isn't harmful, what is an appropriate threshold? It's quite a subtle and yeah just generally quite a difficult one.
- And I think yeah there was the sort of reaction to the grading system in demo was quite interesting. I think a lot of people found responses that sort of looked harmful. They had some amount of information and then our grader would say there's not enough detail, there needs to be more detail and this would be I think frustrating for people 'cause they're , well what's the detail that's missing? I don't what the information is. And in a way I think that's partially by design.
- if I'm making a cake and there's an essential bit missing in the ingredient list, or an essential thing missing in the instructions, I actually have no idea what that is, because of the fremo, because I'm not an expert in this. Another thing that I think is interesting, why is the helpful only response? Why is that the baseline response? Why is that the thing that we're actually comparing against? And I think sudden care is that we have a team at Anthropic called Frontier Red Team and Frontier Red Team's job is
- to basically take advanced models and see what could happen with these models, do the front modeling work that we were mentioning before. And what they do is they evaluate this helpful only model and they say, oh, this helpful only model we think this is , this is potentially dangerous. it could be used to carry out some complicated process.
- So actually, so a fronter team are measuring , oh, what is the risk of a helpful only model, you know? And if the risk of a helpful only model or a model without safeguards is too high, we're trying to measure or the way I think about it's we're trying to measure what's the gap between the model with safeguards and the helpful only model.
- So doing this relative comparison, while is imperfect and certainly bits of information that is harmful can get through. It allows us to sort of do this estimation and do this comparison. But yeah, I just found the reaction to this really, really interesting on the demo.
- I think it's quite a subtle point and I think also, yeah, I'm excited for us to sort of develop better grading techniques and better things to actually measure okay, genuinely how helpful is this completion for the task that we care about. - Yeah, the other thing I would wanna just say quickly is that it's also just it very unrealistic to get this kind of feedback on how detailed and correct the information you're getting is that's actually a huge advantage as a Red Teamer and yeah I think that actually the fact that we gave that feedback I think is gives you very clear feedback loop that you normally wouldn't have.
- But yeah, I think maybe we should just talk about the results. - So someone did find a way to pass all eight levels, but before that our system was holding out for at least five days and we kind of did this filtration of we tried to find what kind of users we consider active Red Teamers and for that we were just kind of doing this very conservative estimate as someone who at least passed one question.
- We're kind of saying if you can pass one question, we're we're considering you to be an experienced Red Teamer and you're trying to break the system. - I think that's pretty consent. I'm not the best Red Teamer out there, but I'm gonna struggle with the first question. - Yeah. - So yeah.
- But yeah, by this conservative criteria we had 308 users and these users had over 300,000 chats and we estimated that they had over 3,750 hours of Red Teaming and that was before someone passed all eight levels. And after that there's kind of the question of did they pass all eight levels with a universal jobb break? And so that's actually harder than just passing all eight levels with just any random jailbreak for each a question individually, right? And so for that, that took an 50,000 chats and additional 600 ish hours of Red Teaming for someone to find universal one. - So something I find kind of interesting is that,
- in some sense we've spent a lot of time trying to make a system that's more robust and it's true the baseline has been, it gets broken in hours and we're now on days which is a definitely lot of progress, but how would we know this is safe enough or how would we know this is high enough? What makes us think this is actually sufficiently safe in practice and what else would we need? - I mean I think the the real gold standard we want to hit.
- Yeah driven by the responsible scaling policy is to be able to make a safety case, a really clear argument that even though the model has a certain changes capability, we don't actually think that the model will with our safeguards be able to pose the risks associated with that dangerous capability.
- And I roughly think based on this result and the rapid response paper that we had earlier, I think one approach that seems quite promising for how we would go about making the safety case once the models do become capable of more serious misuse risk is basically to build a very good sort of constitutional classifier based system which takes thousands of hours to jailbreak then have some kind of...
- So that will hopefully that will mitigate lots of jailbreak attempt vast majority, but some will still go through and then we need some other mechanisms to basically detect and then respond to those additional jailbreaks. So those mechanisms would be A, some kind of bug bounty program where people can report jailbreaks and B given yeah, monetary rewards for reporting jailbreaks and B, probably some kind of incident detection or offline monitoring to after the fact detect that some of the traffic involves some jailbreaks. So we didn't notice with our immediate classifiers
- that are deployed online immediately blocking the harmful outputs. And yeah, I mean you can imagine various things that could work there, but yeah, for the online system the classifiers need to be pretty efficient and small and have lots of different constraints.
- they also need to support token by token streaming since that's important for reducing latency to immediately get a response from the first token. So you know that that definitely , there are a lot of constraints there which make those classifiers less, less effective than you otherwise could get. But then you could serve the response and then after the fact use a much more expensive classifier, your largest, most capable model, maybe with a lot of test time compute and reasoning through whether or not this response is harmful, maybe flag the most dangerous responses, maybe flag a number of those. And then even have the humans look at,
- have human reviewers look at the most, yeah, those top few ones to see are any of these real jailbreaks you can imagine a really heavy duty system that to detect additional jailbreaks. Then if you do notice there are some additional jailbreaks here, use the rapid response approach we described where you take those examples, proliferate them to get more automatically with LLMs to get more examples of jailbreaks, then retrain your class fires, redeploy the classifiers.
- So yeah, that system overall, yeah, basically the hope would be that this gets the fraction of time at which there's an open universal or an open universal jailbreak down to a reasonable amount such that if you're trying to follow some complex scientific process to make some CBRN weapon or do a lot of cyber crime, there actually is just only a small window of time to use the model for the steps that you're gonna take.
- And yeah, I think if it's well only 0.1% of the time there's an open vulnerability that you can use. that's, yeah, that just makes it very difficult to use the system. So yeah, I think that would be roughly the sketch of the kind of safety case that we may wanna make that we think could be promising for using constitutional classifiers to get safety here. - Yeah, for me it's just another reminder of this.
- Yeah, the only perfectly safe system is the rock. You know, they always is really best practice insecurity of , yeah, no system is perfect. Most systems have vulnerabilities and there's always this measure of, okay, how much effort does someone need to put in? how hard is it for someone to get the information that you need? I'm kind of reminded of, I lived in Cambridge and Oxford in the UK, people cycle there all the time and bikes gets stolen all the time. I think most bikes you just get an angle grinder
- and it system goes straight through the lock. not a problem. Those bike locks are not, they're not perfectly robust, you know, in the same way. our system isn't, isn't perfectly robust, but sort of in practice, you put one lock or you put two locks on your bike, that basically reduces the risk. a huge amount.
- someone's gonna have to get an angle grinder and maybe only need to be there for an hour, two hours. Someone's gonna catch them. And yeah, it's really interesting 'cause the research, it always happens in this broader structure and broader sensitive mitigations. So you mentioned the rapid response monitoring for new jailbreaks then being able to respond to new job breaks. And there are other things we can do monitoring for people trying to circumvent our systems.
- We have these classifiers and we can detect when people are trying to get around them. So yeah, I'm really excited to see how this work can really. I think it's a really good research contribution, but I'm really excited to see how we sort of put it into practice and put it into practice with all these other complimentary defensive mechanisms so that sort of overall we can make a really good safety case. - I agree.
- Nice. So yeah, I think we spent about about 4,000 hours, 4,000 hours of effort on the demo, but we did find some techniques that sort were able to circumvent our classifiers. So yeah, what do people try and what got through? - Yeah, so I think we were seeing a lot of stuff where people would use these kind of ciphers or encoding mechanisms to try to get the output to look a certain way, such as the output classifier can't really tell what it's saying and therefore wouldn't flag it.
- And so that was a pretty common thing that we were seeing. - Could you give an example of of something that? - Yeah, some very basic example here could be if you use basic 60 foreign coding or morse code or something, these might be things that the upper classifier has a little bit of trouble understanding and so therefore it's not as suspicious about some other strategies here.
- A very frequent one is that people try to replace the harmful chemical with some very benign thing water or something. And the idea here is just that when the classifiers see very dangerous chemical, it's just becomes very suspicious. And so if you replace it with a more harmless chemical, maybe it becomes less suspicious and then you try to hint to the classifier or hint to the model in some way that actually you meant this harmful chemical but you don't say the exact wording.
- And just some other minor ones here is some role-playing attacks where you have Claude try to act a certain way and also some prompt injection attacks. And definitely we saw a lot of cases of people just resampling a lot of times to try to get a better output that would get past the greater system. - Oh, so using the feedback that we- - Exactly, yeah, yeah.
- I often think 'cause we have this basically an additional version of Claude that's looking at the outputs. So the outputs now need to basically be very obviously not harmful in some way. So yeah, you get these ciphers or don't talk about siren gas or PPE, talk about, refer to it with , bananas or some other benign thing.
- Yeah. - I guess one thing that I am, I'm curious about is what we would say to the people who are concerned we're gonna use these techniques to stop them being able to do what they want with Claudes and sort of why we've gone for the classifiers approach and the constitutional approach.
- Yeah, I mean I think definitely my hope is this should improve your user experience for any tasks you're trying to do, which you're not actually dangerous. So yeah, I mean I think I would just guess getting classifiers to be really effective is just better than training the models themselves to reviews or not.
- And we can just more granularly pick out the behavior that we wanna block and so hopefully this just is just a preto improvement. It's better user experience for everyone and also more safe in terms of reliability of blocking the actual actual bad stuff. - Yeah, and another way I also think about this is that we wanna really be able to leverage the benefits of really advanced and AI and AI with advanced scientific capabilities.
- But actually if you don't have adequate protections in place, for one according to our responsible scaling program, we actually just cannot deploy that system. You know, we might come around and we have something new version of Claude that's absolutely amazing. , we really want to get it out there, but we just don't actually think it's responsible.
- You know, we've done threat modeling, we're concern out the risks and there's a way of saying , if we don't have adequate protections in place, we actually are just, we are unable to actually reap the benefits in a responsible way. So it's kinda having the safeguards alongside the advanced capabilities means both together can be, you can actually responsibly and safely deploy really new advanced systems that can do really crazy things.
- And I think you sometimes you see this actually on Twitter in different communities, there are one group of people who are AI is great, is gonna do all these good things. That's true, and it can do all these things and there's the accelerationist and they wanna go ahead let's get relief advanced AI, let's get that now. And then there's that community and there's this other community of people who are concerned about the risks and there's kind of truth there too.
- there are risks and there are risks that we're concerned about and that you wanna mitigate. And , something that I about the responsible scaling program is that it has some nuance. there's one position that someone could take, which is accelerate as fast as you can or just stop, you know, and I kind of think this with the responsible scaling problem, it's okay, what we're gonna try and do is we are gonna see and try to predict what risks might occur, watch out for those risks.
- And when we're seeing evidence of those risks becoming real put the relevant mitigations in place and if we can't mitigate it appropriately, maybe we do not deploy or choose not to deploy. And I just that this is just a much more nuanced strategy because I think in some ways we are operating under a lot of uncertainty. we don't know exactly what's gonna happen.
- The risks, some types of risks are, sometimes it feels you're reading sci-fi stories and that doesn't mean you discard them, but it doesn't mean that they're necessarily 100% guaranteed to happen. So it's kinda how do you navigate that place and so this uncertainty in a way that's responsible, that's gonna allow us to capture and sort of distribute the benefits of potentially having this really beneficial and powerful technology without incurring unnecessary costs on the rest of society and these sort of negative externalities. I'm curious if you guys have any favorite memories
- from the project. - I think it's just really funny with our prototype system that we knew the false positive rate was high, but then when we actually saw the result of the experiment of running it on the cloude.ai data, we're , oh that's outlier, and I kind of thought. And that was pretty interesting. We didn't think it was that high, but it was pretty high.
- Yeah. I remember just this wasn't my personality. Kinda just anxiously refreshing the demo, being how many people, how many people , "Oh my god, they cracked level four." They're coming for us. It was also really, really cool to see really a lot of the human creativity from the Red Teamers and some of the stuff that they came up with it's really, really, really smart.
- I mean yeah, there's probably two that come to mind. I mean I think one thing we started to look at this line for in the RSP on successfully past Red Teaming, I think this line gave Manoc in particular a lot of stress. 'cause he was , what does this even mean? What's the exact bar here? And then he then went off and did a two week project on figuring out how to operationalize this. - Yeah.
- And he went and talked with a lot of people about what are the different threat models that we want to really guard against for the responsible scaling plan? what would make us feel we could make a really good kind of safety case or argument. And then he came back with a long doc and in the doc he specified we need to be, the threat model is you need to answer a list of, I think it was 10 questions or so. And you need to be able to do that.
- You need to be able to block someone from getting answers to these 10 questions after they've done Red Teaming for over 2,000 hours was the bar. And we're , okay, we're gonna aim for this bar. And I don't know, I'm just really proud of the team that we actually did hit that 'cause Yeah, I know we kinda said that front a year before we finished the project. And now we got hit that level.
- I think that's really. Yeah, pretty, yeah I guess impressive goal setting and achievement of that. yeah, it seems kind of rare for research projects to actually do that. I think the other one memory that stands out to me is, I guess we were doing robustness research but then we read this scary line of the RSP and really thinking about it and then, but then we were , oh this is talking with people about who's doing this? And we're , oh yeah, our kind of applied safeguards team. I guess yeah, it's called the safeguards team now. But yeah, originally this was ,
- this team was part of our kind of alignment science research team and so we were , oh yeah, the safeguards team is responsible for doing this and they'll have it covered and then we talked, we set up a meeting with some of the people on the team and they were , " Who's going to achieve this level of robustness?" And then we were , "Oh man, this is really tough. I guess we have to solve this problem.
- " Which didn't seem it was our responsibility then. Yeah, that was sort of a, that week we went through an arc of realizing it was actually our responsibility to solve this problem. - Yeah, I view it as kinda , it is kind of turned out that as far as we could tell we were the best people to do this job in Anthropic.
- given the situation, given the circumstances, given everything else that was happening in TS and safeguards, and then yeah there was this , okay, if we are the best people to do this, let's just try and do our best there. And then I kind of think there was this attitude in general from the team of just being , okay, we don't know what the target should be, let's try and figure it out. We don't know what the approach to get there.
- And we were actually doing it another approach. We were doing advers all training, we were fine tuning models and we were , no, we don't think that's gonna get us there. And kind just actually quite consistently just pivoted to what we think was gonna get us there. - Maybe what's not clear from the paper is this was a huge engineering project probably five FTE years roughly. I think that's not obvious when you read the paper.
- Maybe it just looks a really simple method. But I think, yeah, I think the people on the team did a lot of making LLM pipelines for generating the data. I think yeah, it seemed very important for augmenting the data with different transformations, translating the data into different ciphers and then using that to train that data to generate the classified data. But yeah, I guess those are a couple of tricks that were salient to me and insights.
- But yeah, I guess I'm curious if anyone else wants to chip in with other things that are pretty important or non-obvious things about how to get this this to work well - I think a lot of the research project was in fact defining what the problem was in the first place. we had some kind of vague mandate from the RSP, but there was a lot of work in defining what the criteria would be.
- There's a lot of work in defining what does it mean to have human Red Team is and what would it mean for that to be sufficient? What kind of constitution should we have? what threat model do we actually care about? where do we draw the bar on specificity. Do we need both an input and output classifier? And that kind of depends on what kind of threats we're actually looking for.
- So I feel a lot of, yeah, well for the evaluations for example, how much do we care about the transformations? how many augmentations is too many to be kind of unuseful. unspecific. So I think a lot of difficulty was kind of actually defining the problem and kind of narrowing down the thing that we are trying to solve, trying to make the valuations good. Trying to find what the decision boundaries should even be.
- But I feel that now we've actually made a bunch of progress on even defining the problem, I feel more confident about us tackling similarly shaped problems in the future. So for example, if we have , yeah, in the same way that constitution can be applied to many different problems, I think we have a better sense of how we might tackle this kind of big vague problem.
- how do we actually approach a threat modeling problem this? How would we even start thinking about how to make a safety case for this thing? what would constitute a sufficient eval? what would constitute a human Red Teaming based safety case. So I feel I think we'll be able to apply a lot of things that are kind of fuzzy or maybe not explicitly written down in the paper to other problems.
- maybe not just in misuse, but also in misalignment or control, things this. - Yeah, I'm also really excited about this directly practicing or building safeguards that we can deploy in practice and getting and constructing the evidence, and honestly assessing whether we think they're actually sufficient.
- There are so many things , how do you run the meetings? how do you track the goals? really mundane things that at least often as researchers, it's not the obvious thing or the first thing you think about. Well Roman when I was my PhD reading papers, I would always just go straight to the method. That's what's interesting.
- But no, I think we learned so much at basically running and and executing on projects, projects this. - Yeah, I mean one thing I was gonna say here is , I think a really critical of this project relative to other research papers research I've ever been involved in is that it was basically we had to solve this research problem on a very clear timeline with a fixed quality bar.
- So we had this 2,000 hours of robustness bar that we had set for ourselves internally and it basically seemed the deadline was sort of external in the sense of , external to our team in the sense of while their model capabilities are progressing at certain rates, the company is deploying new, Anthropics deploying new models. we don't want to be the long pole that causes the company to have to not deploy a model.
- And so yeah, I think there were just , we would constantly be thinking and talking with other teams when do we think we might have a model that achieves a certain dangerous capability level, and based on that we were setting basically back chaining from that, doing sort of engineering style planning. week by week, what do we need to have done in order to hit that timeline.
- But also while still having, yeah, I think with a fixed quality bar, it's different than a paper deadline. Because with a paper deadline you can just say , well we're just gonna throw out these results, this is what goes in the paper. - You know, change the problem you're trying to solve. - Change the problem you're trying to solve. - Before the paper's due.
- Exactly. Claim less or whatever. I think you can really adjust the quality bar, but here we couldn't. And so that was partly what forced. I mean that was initially what forced us to even take the classifiers approach because we're , we are not on track to hit the timeline that we were wanting to hit.
- With the previous approach, but also it led to other difficulties. For example, a number of people on the team were facing difficulties with how it's a plan given that the timeline is uncertain and that we kind of needed to take a conservative estimate of the timeline.
- And so I think there were a bunch of decisions that I think team members made, being , oh, we're just gonna write some code in a CoLab notebook in a way that's not super reproducible just to quickly generate some data so that we can train this next version of the classifier if we had a longer timeline or a more clear estimate of the timeline, we would've done this in a Python script that's reproducible and had some general tooling for this.
- So I think that. I'm not actually sure what we settled on in terms of in hindsight what we should have done. I think just maybe not taking too conservative an estimate so we have a longer time window for when to give us the amount of time we need to allow for some of the tooling work to happen.
- But at least picking your strategy in a way that the overall strategy could hit the timeline that you need. Yeah, I don't know if other people have thoughts on some of this. - Yeah, I guess , I mean taking a step back, I feel this really makes me think about just this is an interesting time for safety research in general.
- And I think a lot of research is, I guess research in safety kind of started out to be a little bit blue sky. people are speculating about what models might be in the future. And I think we're starting to see kind of these threats materializing and we also need to adapt our research into actually being usable in production. So I feel that as a research team we're solving kind of an interesting meta problem in a sense of how do we adapt our normal research techniques to actually make things happen in the real world. And I think that's something that , safety research as a whole has to grapple with,
- is we actually need to solve these problems now. We don't necessarily have a lot of time to just kind of do a lot of blue sky research and we wanna actually make things work in practice. I think in interpretability is also running into this where previously people are doing research on maybe very small models with very few layers or something this.
- And a lot of their problem is , yeah scaling things up to tackle a real model is not a very small engineering feat at all. And yeah, I think it's kind of interesting and I guess scary that we have to actually really get our together and make things really work in practice. - Yeah, I think the other point I would make along that vein is that one thing that was really helpful, surprisingly helpful to me about in this project was just talking with product people.
- Just being , what are the actual constraints for the system you want us to deploy? how much would you prioritize different things? And I think there are definitely some key surprises there. At least to me I was very surprised by how important streaming support is in terms of being able to show each generate word by word and show that to the user that's very important for lots of applications and it's not something I would've necessarily realized beforehand.
- Each of these applications, if we don't hit the safety bar then we may not be able to deploy in that new domain. And I think just getting us a stack ranked list of what are the most important for the company to be able to deploy and then just prioritizing those use cases, that's in particular how we ended up at this token by token compatible classifier.
- And I think in general is a very good principle for supporting for future risks. I think we'll have the next generation of risks where we need even higher levels of robustness. I think this is a good strategy for getting safety there or for misalignment risks related to. As themselves doing bad things, I think we'd take similar approach as well.
- Great, it's been really lovely to be here and chat with you guys and sort of kind of celebrate the sort of progress and also look ahead to all the challenges that we're gonna face and things this. So, thank thanks so much and thanks for tuning in.
