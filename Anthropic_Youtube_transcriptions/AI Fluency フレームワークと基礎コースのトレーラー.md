- Let's begin our exploration of the AI fluency [Music] framework. I'm Joe Feller. My name is Drew. I'm Maggie Vo. My name is Rick [Music] Dacon. The focus of this course is not really about AI as a technology. Instead, it's mostly about you and I, us humans, and how we interact and collaborate with AI systems.
- We explore AI fluency, our ability to engage with AI systems in ways that are effective, efficient, ethical, and safe. It's about imagining possibilities that don't treat AI as some sort of next level spellch checker, but instead as a trusted partner for doing creative and innovative problem solving work. This will help you develop an intuitive feel for what generative AI can do and how best to work with it.
- We're all learning together how to navigate this rapidly evolving landscape. This course is about fundamentally shifting how we approach AI.
