## 原文書き起こし

- There's never been a worse time problem. There's never been a worse night problem. There's never been a worse night problem. There's never been a worse night. There's never been a worse time problem. There's never been a worse time. Problem has never been a better time. A better time to have a problem. To be stuck, to be overwhelmed, to be impatient, to be out of ideas or out of your depth, out of breath.
- There's never been a better time to have a medical condition. Just look at the research being done. To have no qualifications, no resources, to not understand, feel insignificant, to feel restless. Right now, there really has never been a better time. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
