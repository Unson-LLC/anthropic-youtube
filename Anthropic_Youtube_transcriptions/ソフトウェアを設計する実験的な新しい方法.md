## 🧪新実験「Imagine with Claude」：AIが“即時に”ソフトウェアを構築する世界

### 💡 概要

- **「Imagine with Claude」は、従来の「コードを書く→実行する」プロセスを省略し、Claudeが直接インターフェースを生成**する実験的アプローチ。
- コードを書いて設計するのではなく、**ユーザーの操作や意図に応じてその場でUIを生成**する。

---

### ⚙️ 従来との違い

- 事前にコードを用意するのではなく、**リアルタイムでソフトウェアが“自分自身を生成”**する。
- 例：「Xをクリック → たぶんYを見たいのだろう → Claudeがその場でYを生成」。

---

### 🚀 意義と未来像

- 現在の例は遊び的なものであっても、**根本的な仕組みが革新的**。
- 将来的には、「必要なときに、必要なソフトウェアを即座に生成する世界」も視野に。
- **あらかじめ作られたソフトではなく、“その場で生まれるソフト”の時代**が訪れる可能性。

## 原文書き起こし

- We've been experimenting with a new way for AI to build software. It's called Imagine with Claude. Imagine with Claude is still building software, but we've cut out the middleman. Instead of writing code that describes this text box, Claude just makes the text box. We've given it access to software tools that construct software directly and substantially faster.
- Here, Claude isn't writing code in the standard way. It doesn't have to plan it all out in advance. Instead, it generates new software on the fly. When we click something here, it isn't running pre-written code. It's producing the new parts of the interface right there and then. As you can see from the thought process Claude is working out from the overall context what you want to see.
- The user has clicked on X so that must mean they want to see Y. It then produces it right before your eyes. On the surface, this might seem like only a subtle distinction from what you've seen before. And the example we've picked here is just for fun. But the underlying approach of this experiment is quite different.
- This is software that generates itself in response to what you need. Rather than following a predetermined script. In the future, will we still have to rely on premade software or will we be able to create whatever software we want as soon as we need it? With this new experiment, you can imagine things being very different.
